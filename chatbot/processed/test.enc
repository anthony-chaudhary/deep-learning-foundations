Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
That's because it's such a nice one.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Sure have.
I was?
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
The "real you".
No.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Why?
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
What if she never starts dating?
Oh, God.  It's starting.
The prom?  Kat has a date?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
You told me that part already.
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
It's about time.
How'd you do it?
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
Does it matter?
You didn't
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
You -- covered in my vomit.
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
This is so patronizing.
Why?
Were you in jail?
Start a band?
What are you doing here?
You 're so --
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
How?
What?
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Because I like to torture you.
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
No, Daddy.
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
Ever been to Club Skunk?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
In the microwave.
What just happened?
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
You can see for yourself.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Father...
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
What...?  Do I have so many already?
Chief says...
He understands.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
I knew you would.
The ocean is uncrossable?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
And what do you think Mendez?
What's he doing?
You must be mad...!
We're lost!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Then why?
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
But it's...
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
No.
I know.
A cop?
End my career?
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Vodka tonic.
What's he looking for?
Takin' a bath.
Sorry...PD only.
Are you hit?
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
My folks are.
I'll let you know what happens.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
What's your accomplishment.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
And what do you do with the bones?
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
Let her go!  Let her go!!
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
We are both from Prague.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Who is he?
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Don't speak Russian!
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Did you hurt her?
A job?
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
Well, he...
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
CONTINUED
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
The antenna has to be replaced.
CONTINUED
Oh, thank you very much.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
How is gregor?
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Are you quite sure?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
This is three years old.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
How about chargin' the battery?
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
I ain't tired yet.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
What do you think?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
No class...
Notice something funny about that bus?
You okay?
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Whaddya think?
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Three more hours...
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
When?
You chickenshit punk...
Rosalie, you okay?
Five bills.
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
...We're saved!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
...would you like a drink?
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
You noticed...
She's an exception..
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
Good luck..
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
They really made her...
Leeloo... is... she's...
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
How many points you got left on your license?
...What's your name?
...Hi.
Six to the left. One to the right.
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
Why?... Why would you need me?
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
They just landed in the desert.
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Welcome home.
How's the detective business?
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
Dino...
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
I'll consider it.
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
You're a dead man.
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
Who is Machine?
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
What did you do with her body?
Stop talking.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
You are a private investigator?
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
They're no friends of mine.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Shut your mouth and drive!
You're asking me why?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
You almost went over your limit.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
You don't need to be here.
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
Nothing remotely like this.
You're joking.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
Yes... ?
Yes, but...
What was she running from?
Yes.
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
Are you religious?
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
How... how can you say that to me...?
Hello... ?
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
No... no... no...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
Yes... I remember Mary
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
Extra money, huh?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Rick, please.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
So?
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
Feeling better now?
You don't get it, he's after me...
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
It's lonely in there, in my room.
Mommy...?
Where is he?
Very funny.
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
He sure loves to stay awake.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
How is he - ?
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Yes, Griff?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
Anything ---
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
What do you think?
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Why?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Chub says you're fired.
This spring.
You heard the news.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
Mmm.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Double A. New Britain.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
In the chest.
On your sleeve.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Do what?
Yeah. It's stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
But it's not funny now.
I don't want to.
What then?
I called Mommy.
Yes.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Okay.
I know.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
See. Get your boots.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
I'm sorry about what I said.
Yeah. I mean that.
Tonight. Let's get together.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
You knew me as a kid.
I know your parents.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
How?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
Hold on!
This town sucks.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Where... how'd you hear that?
Just do it.
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Call it what you want.
Crawl!
No shit.
The night before the shooting.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
Daddy. Daddy, please...
I don't drink coffee.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
Did we warn them off?
It's cut.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
I prefered the terrorists.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
You're pointing a gun at me.
What do you want with us?
What do you know of my husband?
Do you have to be so brutal?
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Four...
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
I'll not going without my family.
I don't know why you stayed.
Flying the plane.
Someone should give you a raise.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
Shit.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
What is it, Mary?
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Elaine.
If that's the way you want it.
Not now, Elaine!
Elaine, we have to go back.
What word would you use, Elaine?
Are you afraid?
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
Negative.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
Yeah.
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
What?
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
No.  Poached.  Over.
What should I say?
Captain Oveur?
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
You can't go in there!
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Ah, won't you sit down?
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
No. I'm all alone.
Surely you can't be serious.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
What's the matter?
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
Rain.
But Ted, you're the only...
You promise you'll write.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
Hi!
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Yes?
You okay?
You are Cassandra?
He's not here.  Why ask me?
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
What is wrong?
What is this?
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Screw you.
Was.  Divorced.
Your health...
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
But there's no more drug.
Only holds five.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
The human?
Yeah, Sykes?
Talk to me, Hudson.
Okay, let's do it.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
No.  There's no way!
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Thanks.
Terrible.
Burke!  Open the door!
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
Mommy...Mommy?
Can we dream?
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Where?
What's that?
Why?
What did you think of the music?
You have leave to try.
Why what, sir?
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
What is it?
No! No! No!
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
I see.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
These are originals?
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
He needs me, ma'am.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
This is not his handwriting.
How much will you pay him?
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Hey!
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Gertrude!
It's just a trifle, of course.
May I try it?
Yes?
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
What do you mean, Sire?
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Is she not here?
How is your financial situation?
They say you're in debt.
How many?
No, really!
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
Father -
Not that I've seen.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
What?
Yes.
No.
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
I can't say. Really
Really? Why?
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
What dead? Who is dead?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
You mean she's not coming back?
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
The doctor thinks I am. But -
What?
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Of course.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Consigned to flames of woe.
Strange!
Yes.
With the tenors.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
I do not seek forgiveness.
Where?
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
I did.
No, you didn't!
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
What do you mean - now?
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
Did he say a wolf?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
David?
It was a wolf.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Now what do you want to talk about?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
That's easy enough.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
What?
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
Are you better now?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Charming.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
No.
No what?
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
All right, you two, move along.
What time is it?
How long have I been here?
You've never had bad dreams before?
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
I really don't know.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
I assume full responsibility.
Hello.
You ask them.
Go on, ask them.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
Beware the moon?
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
Did you hear that?
Plan?
Nice doggie. Good boy.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
David!
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
It's you, David.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
Jack, are you really dead?
You look awful.
Hello.
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
What can we do to assist you?
He's on the telephone.
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
I don't rightly know, sir.
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
Oscar, what's the matter?
Charlie!
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything—
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
I'm sorry, Dude, but—I—
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
What is?
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Well—
Don't you know?
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Good morning.
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
Mine too?
With what?
Oh, ten dollars—
No.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
Dude Finlay?
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
Then who changed it?
What time did you get in?
Everybody in?
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
How'd they --
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Yesterday.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
How many of them did he kill?
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
He's been full of vinegar lately.
What?
What you sayin' boy?
I think I recognize you.
How?
Ride with me, cousin?
The James-Younger Gang.
It's not a bank.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
A bad idea.
Missed you, cousin.
Strategically.
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
You're right, sir.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
He thinks this is some kind of game!
Hello, Liberty Missoura!
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
"Big and older"?
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
Don't care.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
Jesse, we're outlaws.
We're drunk.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Uncle Frank?
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
A river pirate.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Not if I find the right girl.
And what's this right girl like?
Sparkling rocks?
Let the law --
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Don't turn around.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Mmm.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
I swear.
What about that Rock Island bastard?
Thank you, Miss -- ?
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
How did you know?
Yes?
I'm thinking Dorsia.
You like it there, don't you?
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Luis is a despicable twit.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
I want a firm commitment.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
Doesn't he live here?
Are you sure?
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
It looks so soft.
Patrick?
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
Don't, I'll drink it.
Dorsia, yes?
We are totally booked.
Just...say...no.
Patrick?
Jean?
Yes, Patrick?
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Want a bite?
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Interesting.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
Where are you?
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Uh huh?
Paul Owen.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
No, really. I'm okay.
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Nice. Very nice.
You sure?
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Nothing.
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
Not a big music fan, eh?
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
What am I gonna do?
Listen, what's your name?
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
Yes, Owen?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
Is it over?
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
Didn't you visit the campus?
When's Brian coming for the TV?
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
What're you -- what?
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
...Why?
Look at this.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
Great!
You look beautiful.
Milo?
My goodness.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
What?!
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
...Hello?
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
'Think I should buy some originals?
Had you talked to him much lately?
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
The wrong place?
You look a little tired.
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
This is good. Who did it?
What'd the girl say?
Let's go.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
You calling Phil and Randy?
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
You're compulsive.
I snuck into #21.
Why would you do a thing like --
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
How close are you?
But they'd still get the idea, right?
Before they kill somebody else, too.
You mean -- break in?
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
...You got my E-mail?
I don't know.
What're they building?
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
We know all that, Exposition.
Good luck, Austin.
Yes?
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Thank you, Exposition.
She's working on another lead right now.
There's one more thing, Austin.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
Do I make you horny?
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
Watch out, you're on my hair!
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
Are you crazy?
Austin, I'm coming with you.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Is it one of ours?
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Right.
Hi.
An evil vet?
Blow me.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
Great.
Why?
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
Really?
... love ...
Fear ...
I have an appointment.
How curious ...
We want to help...!
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
You.
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Valentine, listen to me ...
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...
You're mad.
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
Then what's stopping you?
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
Any ideas?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
But you did suspect me.
Not for a moment.
You're playing games.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I told Mother I took care of you.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
What's that you're wearing?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
I'll be back ...
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
What kept you?
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Where's Mother?
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
Global warming?
How did you guess?
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
Guilty until proven innocent?
That's what we're going to find out...
Seventy-five hundred.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I don't want any trouble.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Yes, sir, I am.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
Cole, we've got to talk.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
Are you going to have women at your party?
What's the matter?
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
I don't believe you.
Great bathing suit.
It's true.
I'll take some.
That's it.
You want to share it?
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
Really?
Ha, ha, ha.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
Under the table!
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
Oh these moments do try me...
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
-- Knock it off!
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
Is he...
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
Been ripping off fire stations?
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
I'm in heaven, Lt.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
You're selling dad's boat?
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
-- What are you doing here?
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
Hi.
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Well, you did invite me here.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
What?
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
Did you pull me out?
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Do you have to do that?
They're waitin' man.
You can't talk about my brother like that...
He's going to be a fireman.
What's wrong?
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
Shadow.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
It knows us. This one knows us.
Inspector.
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Me?
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
I forgive you.
All right. What are you gonna do?
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
Yeah, him.
We're ready when you are.
Seconds and thirds, too.
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
So that's what you been doing?
You can walk away.  We both can.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
What kind of show is this gonna be?
We might need some mo' money behind this.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
You're now Mantan.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
How you sound?
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
Go on.  Good so far.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
This has to be a big mistake.
Go away, unless you got my money.
Good woman.  I trained her right.
I love you too, Daddy.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
Hello.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
Why'd you do that?
So they can be on TV.
No joke.  Serious.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Where is he?
How did you get this gig?
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
You sing and dance?
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
...then what about...
How be dat?
I don't know who I am.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
No, before my time.
Never read a book in my whole life.
Y'know what?
Why don't you answer?
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
I have acted as I think fit.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
The coward!
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
All Europe shall hear of this!
I have no luggage.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
That is a trifle strong.
No.
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
I feel the ribbon.
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
Was he cheated?
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
May I be quite frank with you?
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
Some.
That son of a bitch.
That'd be my reaction too --
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
Sir, yes, sir!
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
What do you mean, West's?
You hated West more than any of us.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Why?
I don't know --
MAYBE WHAT --
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
And the problem is you only got three.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
What are you talking about?
You're crazy --
You and the Colonel go back.
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
He's in interrogation?
Yes.
Move him.
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
You're off to a late start.
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
That bugs you too?
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
We were close to something with Kendall.
This isn't the time --
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
Bullshit --
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
Or are you too scared?
Then do it.
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
Well, she... uh...
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
So I've heard.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
Jesus Christ.
Am I?
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
You know where the chemicals are?
Dad?
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
How can I convince you to stop?
I can't imagine any place better than here.
'Fraid so.
Hello.
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
It's bad.
You need to go.
You never told me how your parents met.
That's because most of it never happened.
But it's not true.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
Did you and Dad have any other property?
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
What do you mean?
What's this?
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
Do you like it?
What? What are you doing?
I'm asking what you're here for.
Oh.  We are Russian.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
She says she has a secret to tell.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
Oh Jesus.
Yes.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
No I don't.
Give me some money.
Fine.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
Oh Jesus.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
And who says what is wrong.
Some... What does that mean?
So now you hate all women?
What?
What? I... I wasn't saying...
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
Please. Why not?
Okay. Goodbye.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
How do you want to pay?
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
That young lady's size, right'cher.
Yeah.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
Rose... please...
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
Or what? OR WHAT?
Well I don't...
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Why you got me chained?
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
You some kind'a pervert?
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
We drinkin' buddies now?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
What'chu sayin'?
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
You won't at the square this mornin'.
Please don't tell my daddy.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
Holy shit!
What?
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
What happened to your face?
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
I just wanted some make-up.
Why?
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
Short shift?
All right, how's the new partner?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
Are you expecting anyone?
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
What'd I tell you?
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
Let's go.  Him first.
I don't know.
Why's that?
She ever pull down her shades?
I need someone to translate for me.
Where's the wife?
Who am I supposed to be?
We're in?
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
One guy do all the damage?
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
You had my help, detective.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
You certainly have a nice place here.
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Would you like to be modified?
Why are you staring at us?
What, Sebastian?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
His company made us.
Just thought I'd...
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
Why, yes, of course.
And what in your estimation works?
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
During the road test...
Why didn't you go?
It's a good job.
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
Do I make you nervous?
How come you're not on the job?
Yeah.  Sometimes.
This feels stupid.
How do you know I'm not?
Of course.
I don't have one.
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
Just better.
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Methuselah Syndrome.
Bravo!
My office.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Yes, I'm right?
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
Wait!  Wait!
What is it?!
Oh, I could die...
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
See, ya.
Why doesn't it never work out?
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Why not go to work for me?
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Okay.
What for?
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
You almost got us killed!
Yes!
Um-hum.
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Do I look crazy?
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
I like her.
What have you ordered?
What?
I don't blame you!
Uh-huh. Adam?
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
A card?
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
Well, do we just go on up?!
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
That's what everybody believes?
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
Yeah.
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
That would knock my father out.
Almost all of them.
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
The hotel.
You don't look thirty-five.
The sky?  Where?
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
Well, where are you --
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
What about relatives?
He drank it hot?
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
No.  They all do.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
What?
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
Some time.
Give me your hand.
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Well, what do you think?
I think...it...works.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
He left with Sophie.
What's wrong?
I don't know. I like to think so.
We came back to the house!
Where?!
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Frank. Come in.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
Come into the study a minute.
Jeffrey?
Okay.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Only you and the photo lab.
Not yet.
You don't?
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
No.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Come on Dorothy.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Oh no.
Mommy's here.
Frank?
Can I feel 'em?
Hello?
No thanks.
What time are visiting hours?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Uh-uh.
Yeah, how did you know?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
That's too bad.
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I don't know.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yes. I do.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
Oh, okay, can I call?
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Who, me? Why should it?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay, okay.
Shoot.
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
My father has a gun at home.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Come on out a minute, okay?
Up where?
Fuck you.
Lord's name.
Are ya ready?
You think they sold me out? No way.
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
Mother, is that you?
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Hey Murphy?
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
That was way easier than I thought.
It is your corrupt we claim.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
Rule of thumb?
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
The Greeks. The Italians.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Oh my god!
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
Hello?
Hello?
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
You believe?
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Continue the joke.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
Making Hutch David Soul?
OK. That's wrong.
Dignan, it's --
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Where's the other stocker?
What about what that guy said?
Because my mom gets the bill.
I don't want to use it.
Well, then cut it in half.
See if mine are in there.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
Obviously. That's a given.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
This was in fourth grade.
Where was I?
You don't know how to hotwire.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
I had to give some to Inez.
I want you to look at this.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
Do you like Inez?
Any activity?
Help me move him.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
There's not enough time.
How?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Scale the --
Death.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Who?
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
There's a million places to hide around here.
Bob, where you going?
You think I'm improving?
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Why do you say that?
Give him a second.
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
What do you mean?
Well, what do you think?
You stole a Trans-Am.
I think we might of scared her.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
You really think he'll remember you?
Bob, will you please listen?
I told you they were there.
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
This could be a trap.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
You said 48 hours!
Bullshit.
Come on!
Do they let you --
Come on in!
It's locked.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
There was a mistake.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
And what are we looking for?
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
I want to know what happened.
...this is Conklin's computer.
Do you know what his budget was?
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
May I finish?
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
'Why' would be enough for me.
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
Show me again...
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
What's going on in Berlin?
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
Conklin up front.
It's just a nightmare.
But it ends up the same.
There must be another way!
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
What do you want?
I want someone I know to take me in.
Alright... take it down.
-- who? -- who else is here? --
Mr. Nevins?
You mean, did I want a date?
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
Is it fresh?
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
Someone dead from this household?
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
He won't come.
What news of the north?
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
You'll move
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
We don't split up!
Shall I leave, M'lord?
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
I do not confess.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Thank you for inviting.
Did it work?
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
I am trying.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
But you must have something to go on?
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
No.
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
Sure...
Are you hurting her?
But I... I need those books.
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
Huh?
Oh God... what did we do?
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Of course.
I know, but...
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Like how?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
Because you're... different.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
And...?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
...yes.
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
It didn't feel like a dream.
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Are you sure you even packed it?
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
Meant no offense.
My husband is with me, too.
So you decided to go to America.
You want my advice?
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
Occupied France?
A franc for your thoughts.
Yes?
Yes, of course, we --
Please.
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
Richard, I had to see you.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
No, not yet.
No.
It's been a long time.
Does he always leave so early?
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
Apparently he has the letters.
Did he give any reason?
He suggested I ask you.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
How do you do?
Your work.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
Yes.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
For the time being.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
But everybody's having such a good time.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
Victor Laszlo.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
His escape.
He'll take one.
You're late.
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
I would advise you not to interfere.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
He'll double what I pay you.
Boss!
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Boss, let's get out of here.
Save some for tomorrow.
Get up.
Thirsty.
No.
Get water!
Fix raft first.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
They're harder to do than they look.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
You?  Personally?
Merry Christmas eve.
Four four.  A record.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
You know, for when you travel.
You can't go now.
I have to.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
What's that?
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
It means a lot...that you came.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
Which I didn't have.
I am one lucky guy.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
When'd you start working here?
Can you find her?
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
How'd it go?
But I might not have.
I'm touched.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
You are one sick fucker.
To life.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Better than I can!
What's she so emotional about?
Is your family in the apple business, too?
I know.
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
Please don't make me say it again.
Do you think she'll be all right?
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
No. She was an immigrant.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
Have you enlisted?
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
So. What should I do now?
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
It looks like scurvy.
It's obviously an aborticide.
I don't know it.
I thought it was my turn.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
But you don't look very happy.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
Do you know him?
Mind your own business, Peaches.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
We had to finalize the deal.
Know who I am, Jake?
Grifters...
It's all about the money, isn't it?
So how'd you get caught?
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
She had you tempting fate.
So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
Who's that?
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
Whoa. What?
I'm going home
Eight A.M. flight.
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
I guess it lacks a certain style.
Because you killed one of my crew.
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
How much?
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
I'll worry about Customs.
Mr. King, I think --
What the hell's his problem?
What?
Uh... Everything okay?
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
Jesus... Take it easy.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
No, I want my cut!
Sorry. I didn't know...
It's bad luck.
What?
It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
We never had a problem with that before.
Is it all fugasi?
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
A Fed? Is he close?
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
You guys awake?
What do you want?
What do you get out of it?
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
High five.
Maybe another time.
I hate cheats.
You called the casino a cesspit.
I despise the job.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
What's the Blue Book price?
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Eight-fifty.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
I don't gamble.
I get it.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
I couldn't resist them.
It came my way. 450 a week.
I don't like it.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Leave it.
Leave me alone, Marion.
What?
Yes, I know that.
In the casino.
How did you hurt your hand?
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
Yes.
Detective Inspector Ross.
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
You've done pretty well.
What are you, a cop?
I'm off. I need to sleep.
Rough day?
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
Has he?
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
Where's the magnet?
What makes you so sure?
What for?
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Do you remember the detonation time?
Snap out of it, bomb.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
Right!
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
To explode, of course.
So if you detonate in...
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Any planets?
Commander Powell would have named it.
Fred.
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Yeah?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Sorry.
Bruno's girlfriend.
Yeah.
No?
Some of us are trying to sleep.
How're ya doin', Max.
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
Lemme put some clothes on.
Where'd you clip this?
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
I don't get involved with guns.
Damn... Are you alright?
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Sophy?  Are you okay?
Girl's gotta make a living.
I was expecting someone else.
Who is...
Sorry about your window.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
That would be appropriate, yes.
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
Well, not me personally.
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
Who are you?
How do I know you're telling the truth?
Look, I don't know what you want--
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
This is not a place you wanna go.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
You're crazy.
Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
Straight.
A little what?
You know what I'm saying.
And because he's my friend.
And she bought that?
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Lydia.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
What happens if you level with her?
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
Easy Sketchy.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
He's sick.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
More than anything in the world.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
You got in the car, didn't you?
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
One more time in English.
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
Sunday, but...
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Cool, bro, now listen up...
No... You don't think...?
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
It's my Bullworker.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
They're not idiots.
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
Yeah.
No.
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Not if I shoot first!
What happened?
I feel bad for his family.
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Beg pardon?
When can I squeeze one out?
What did you say?
We went to a hotel.
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
Where are we going?
Why?
And what?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
What's wrong with you?
Hey. You OK?
Did you call the cops?
What?
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
You're such a fuck-ass.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
You're my only son...
Why should we care?
His name is Frank.
He said to follow him.
What is her name?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
Yes.
I... I was playing with fire.
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
You've done it again?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
I can see him right now!
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
What's her name?
Why would I tell Mom?
I was just being honest.
If that's what you think is necessary.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
Excuse me?
That's enough.
No more fuckin' for her.
So, what do I say?
Loretta, never have kids.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
This came for you, sweetie.
Loretta, don't do that.
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
Here, I didn't get any.
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
You don't know where this is gonna...
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
I'm a mirror.
That's right.
Dakota.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
I will if you shut your piehole.
Here I am, Father.
"My President"...
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
Here I am, Father...
Half watch dog?
I don't want him.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Sure.
How'm I doing, boss?
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
Are you sure you're not tired?
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
You upstart!
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
I want him back!
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
Well, yes.
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
Are you comfortable here?
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
You never mentioned his mental state.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
Good day...!
Oh, no.
She's very pretty, your mother.
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
Is he... dying then?
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
My name is...
Good evening. How are you feeling?
This... is my new home?
That's a canopy, John.
Oh, our relatives... the children.
The children! May I see?
The Children. Where are your children
Yes, John?
No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
No, he's very upset about something.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Watery headed bunch.
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
A dressing bag.
Very smart indeed.
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Who, Father?
Please! Please! What are those?
What's the matter?
WHY?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
But you don't realize....
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
There is something I must ask the Gods...
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
REALLY?
Really.
No. 
Well, how d'you think I feel?
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Have you done this sort of thing before?
You don't love ME.
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
About raping me?
About NOT raping you...
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
Why should you care?
But...
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
Halfdan the Black's here!
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
Wait, Erik!
She hasn't got any.
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
Made by YOU, Loki!
You went berserk...
But it's a responsibility...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
He drove me mad!
And you've got BOTH axes?
Thanks, guys.
You rat.
How are you today?
Okay, I guess.
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
It's okay, really.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Huckleberry Hound?
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Take care.
Um --
Frost?
Yeah?
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I think so.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
I don't think we're ready.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
So, um --
No.
Such a beautiful view.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
It's very late.
You said...
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
I don't think I've slept in a year.
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Cool.
Bye, Joel.
Yeah.
Tomorrow?
A bully? Moi?
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I don't know. Panties and --
I just got in.
That's me.
Okay. I wish you could come.
You have to stop this!
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
How was it?
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
Very cool. Trippy.
That's a good one.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
Hey.
And after that?
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Howard, your one o'clock.
I have a family, Mary.
Stan? What's going on?
Well, where was Patrick?
Howard, they've disappeared again.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
Where are the others?
That's Jellybean!
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
What do you think?
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
What are you doing?
Thanks.
Are you in show business?
I was a successful model once.
So now you're bummin' around?
I'm the best.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
Holy shit...
Justin?
From what?
Coop, where are you...
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
No, he didn't.
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
Trauma.
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
What happened?
What's happening...?
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
What does?
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
Patch me through to him.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Any survivors?
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
The date.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
I don't know...
You... You can't do that!
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
It is now.  We're locked in.
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
Carbon dioxide?
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
What is it?
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
I'm not really dressed for a party.
I mean...
What is this? Where's Reed?
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
What's wrong with me?
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
What?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
This is wrong in so many ways.
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
What are you doing --
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
Of course. Of course.
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Come on, Ben, come on...
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
What are you doing?
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
You said it was urgent.
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
You want to work at Carl's?
On the ledge?
This is how I dress all the time.
You are a virgin!
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Are you really a virgin?
So are you.  Are you shaking?
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
Hey, Mike?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
Hey, Rat.
Yo.
Damone. It's Mark.
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
Seen the new Playboy?
Just be glad you're all right.
Don't you like him?
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
Should we buy a frame for that?
No way! He just called him a dick.
You'll always remember your first time.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
How long does Doug take?
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
Yeah, like maybe never.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Mr... Mr. Hand.
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
You look like you could still be in high school.
Is this your first time?
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
This is a nice car.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Do you really have to go?
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
What happened? What did they do to her?
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
GO?
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Jesus.
You degenerate pig!
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
NO! Stop talking like that.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
This is a fucking nightmare.
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Careful.
I will not die because of him!
You know where it is?
We'll meet in three hours?
You got something better?
And that's how I ended up here.
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
You all sure about this?
We just smeared a skunk.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
Why don't you go check it out?
What now, Geronimo?
Oh, no.
Really?
What? Really?
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
What's going on between you two?
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
I'll go with ya.
Welcome back.
Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Well, maybe they migrate?
Hey!
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
What's wrong?
If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
Not without you!!!
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Well...
I'm not lying.
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
Oh. I mean, good.
Who's this?
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
What night?
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
But I'll never win that.
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
See you next weekend?
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Oh no...
Jesus.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
The hell you will, Harry York.
Calm down, Frances.
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
What's left of my blood.
Nice joint. Can you afford it?
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
Oh my God, I look awful.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Frances, You're crazy.
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Pretty morning.
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
That's me, Clifford.
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
Then why did you bring them?
It's your fan mail, little sister.
I think I need a little air.
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
No!
Mama, shut up!
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
Yes...?
Please sit down...
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
...Did you really say that?
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
Huh?
Yes.
You drove him to his torment.
And he drove me to mine.
It can't be as bad as that.
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
This was not taken from a grave.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
Nothing. Still nothing.
So have I
I should go. I should leave today.
Is he not back yet?
Father's so proud.
I wish to be your wife.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
Victor!
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
Are you having me on?
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
That's blasphemy!
Is that your diagnosis?
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
For what?
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Paracelsus?
What is your name?
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
Why?
How is it you come to be here?
I heard.
Creature? A... human like creature?
Do you share my madness?
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
You draw very well.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
Next Friday.
What'll you do when you leave here?
You can only do what you can do.
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
I'm sorry.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Umhummmmph.
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
Twenty-eight.
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
My wife.
Was? As in not anymore?
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
It's a flop house.
Where are you taking us?
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
I never said help us!
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
Do they have cable?
How's it feel?
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
That's what I hear.
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
Pardon?
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
Straight up?
Sir?  What did he say?
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
"Coronado."
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Can't complain, ma'am.
You don't know that.
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
I'm sure it is.
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
I can make this wall without --
Come on, Montgomery...
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
The Navy Cross...
Unless you Whiskey Run.
By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
"In Washington..."
What?
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
You really came back for more?  Of this?
You got anybody, Wick?
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
Would you have shot if it was a man?
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
O'Neil...
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
Where's Audrey?
What?
That why you dumped him?
He stole my report! That's my report!
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
Are you okay?
Five bucks.
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
Somebody must have seen it.
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
We've met before.
Are you sure? How do you know?
Well good, that's very... nice.
This is it?
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
You WILL go out there.
We've got to stop!
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
He's a miserable twit!
Why didn't you stop at the market?
May I get the check?
He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
... Yes?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
Structural damage at 68 percent.
The enemy is matching velocity.
No, I'll kill you. .
...The digital conveyor.
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
It's suicide.
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
They're gone.
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
But I'm the Commander!
There's nobody here. Jason...
Can it be repaired?
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
You have ten seconds.
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
I... certainly, but-
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
Commander...
Well... Sort of...
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Anything.
NO NO NO.
Let's do it, Tommy.
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
The army needs you.
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
Me?  You apologizing to me?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
Who is that!?
How old are you, Captain?
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
I'm not sure.
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
Let's not over do it...
Gag on your own invention, then.
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
Colonel Reed...
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
The man is a traitor!
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
These supplies...?
It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
Not today.
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
Or, 'civilized'.
Then why are you teaching me...?
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
Let's get you darker!
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
Who?
Not too bad.
Where is my nephew?
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
Karen? You okay?
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
Look at me, Ray.
How'd you get in here?
You live in Miami?
I'm a producer.
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
Really? You ever been arrested?
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -– this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer –-
"Mr. Lovejoy".
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
What?
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
You have it?
Who?
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
I'm thinking of a movie.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
That's not bad.
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
We call you a taxi.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
"Cotton".
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
Right. See how your story ends.
I think it's not horrible.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
Sounds fair.
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
You okay?
Were you scared up there?
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
I'm going into the movie business.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
I don't have a dog.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
What?
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
This's gonna hurt a little.
Guess I'll just keep working.
Light in those passages ain't so good.
Mother fucker!
But how long?
Hard to say.
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
How long?
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
Sounds like the hull.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
Bodies're too fresh.
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
I don't know what you're talking about?
I think you know.
You smashed it!
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
You're late.
Morning everybody.
That's a good thing?
What'd he look like?
Lights?
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Why not call for help?
You just shoot at something?
He needs a doctor.
Collision? With what?
The what?
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Over the gold.
They went crazy.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
Ho-ly shit.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
Shut up.
It's a Noaa buoy.
We're still drifting.
Can't find the shotgun.
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
Fifteen, at the most.
Guess.
Someone from the past.
YES.
Pumpkin, are you in there?
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
But I can't --
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
Did you actually do this painting?
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
What do you mean?
Huh?
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
That guy rules!
Yeah, right.
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
No.
Hi Josh.
I just stopped in to say hi.
What do you mean "why"?
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Shut up!
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Hi, Al!
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
SHUT UP!
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
"Funky"?
We still have to go in there sometime.
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Where?
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
He gives me a total boner!
You're just jealous.
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
Go ahead...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
What thing?
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
Just some people from work...
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
Great...
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
Hi.
Wow... finally.
What are you doing here, Melorra?
Shhh!
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Do you have any other old records besides these?
You still interested in that?
Tell me what?
Punk rock is over!
You're late, asshole.
NO!!!
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
Yeah, sure... very funny....
PLEASE? We have to!
Relax, Seymour, relax...
So, why did you bring this along?
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
Hey, can I borrow this?
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
Are you okay?
Aren't you going to get that?
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
Does that mean you don't like me?
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
I hate sports.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
I dunno, I...
What do you want?
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
They're Seymour's.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Please Josh?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Why? What did she tell you?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
What are you talking about?
Yes?
You were contracted to work-
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
No hints, Samuel.
I am a man of peace.
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
And it worked?
What?
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Very good indeed.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.
I'll have to.
Why do the workers look unhappy?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
Oh yes, I think so. 
For you.
Thank you, Samuel.
You've known him long?
Did you ever see a lion that size?
And where will you sleep beautifully?
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
We don't have a relationship.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
Or we could do that.
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
Who are you going to call?
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
Command me, lord.
These boys aren't playing around.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
You were supposed to help me with this.
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Is the line sinking?
I'm Ray --
Like a goat on garbage.
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
Are you telling me how to drive?
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Tell him about the toaster.
Aren't you glad we waited?
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Hi, Louis.
... I thought it was the drug store.
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
Out!
You heard it?
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
He is the Destructor.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
What's that got to do with it?
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
May I please see the storage facility?
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
What on earth gave you that idea?
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
What have you got, Egon?
Did you see anything?
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
Gozer.
What now?
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
What do I say?
Anything!  Just make contact.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
Third floor.  Get down here,
Agile bastard, isn't he?
What?  What popped in there?
Mmmhmmm.
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
Caesar, ignore them.
Take grain away from the army?
Marcus Aurelius has died.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
But have never been?
You cannot die.
Where are they?
Servis made it through again?
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
You need to come home!
When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Will you take me home now?
But, Elaine --
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
You sure you really want to?
That woman. The older woman.
Because -- I am.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
You really will?
Exactly how do you mean?
You a student?
Well here's the purse.
I'd rather not.
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Will you come in, please?
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
What do you drink? Bourbon?
Oh my God.
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
Well I don't know.
I think I'll go to bed.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
I know that. But I'm --
Thank you.
Then why do you keep running away?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Do you understand what I said?
Yes, I do.
Yes.
He didn't see me.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
What?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
This is all terribly wrong.
Are you kidding?
Who said it was my first time?
What one.
I walk out.
Is it?
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
At college.
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
Oh my God.
Good.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
Go home now.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
What have you done to her?
I say I've got it.
Braddock -- Braddock?
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
What about it?
You got me.
Say that again.
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
I've got to go.
Thank you.
You'll never be young again.
No, I don't.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Benjamin -- where are you?
I'd like to discuss this.
It's a short life and a gay one...
Well?
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
Why?
No -- no -- no -- no...
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
How?
I have an idea working in my head... 
He must be very nice.
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
Free --
Would you like to make a man happy?
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
Why do you look at me like that?
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
What can you see?
What?
Really?
And what do you do -- now?
Very early in the morning.
Why later?
Why do you think --
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
Is that too much, Baron?
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
How's the beautiful lady?
The war.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
No, Doctor.
Oh -- but -- I --
You're tired. I can see that.
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
You dance splendidly.
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
That's from skiing.
Definitely off.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Tomorrow morning.
No -- now.
Well?
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
I know you did -- I said you did --
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
You see -- what we are interested in --
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Why not?
I wish to be alone.
It is time for the performance.
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
Hi, Bobo.
I want to keep my teeth.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
You want a drink?
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
You're a thousand percent right!
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
I certainly hope not.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
Here you are! Two rich people!
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
What? He's going to be all right!
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
So I heard.
No?
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
They knocked out my tooth!
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
Lucky? You call that lucky?
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
What's that?
Expecting visitors?
I just came back from Phoenix.
I've really got to --
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
You must have some money.
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
The tap. What you do for a living.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
What happened to Cole?
Where?
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
What's that?
You watch that mouth.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
The cemetery...
That's it?
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I think someone broke into my house.
You sure?
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
You really think Eddie killed her?
Who?!
Looks great.  It does.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
Wait.
Shane's going as a condom.
You're so easy...
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
Mom -- Who is this?
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
What if your parents come home?
Aren't you gonna answer that?
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
Mommy!!!
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
God ... this can't be true.
My, God!  What have you done to him?
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
Jamie's baby ...
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
You've created a monster.
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
Home is important to a man.
Um.
I suppose.
Tell them yourself!
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
This room is full of ghosts.
What'll you do for transportation?
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
I'm liable to find anything!
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
Could have happened to anybody.
First Nagasaki--now this.
I dunno, boy.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
Hi, Penelope.
Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
You did?
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
Gee whiz--
Out!
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Is anybody besides you here now?
Everybody says he was so brave.
England?
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
Mhravitch.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
No.
No.
Gee whiz, Dad--
I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
This is crazy.
Disease?
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
People don't use that word any more.
They don't have to feel like slaves.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
You learned this in some college course?
The doctor.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
No you're not!
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
Sounds quite beautiful.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
You've been bitten by bats?
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
You hope.
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
Don Quixote.
Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
You didn't even find that out?
Dead!
So long, you guys.
Yes.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Ja?
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
Not true.
How did she lose her feet?
In a railroad accident many years ago.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
Mom?
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
It is an emergency, isn't it?
Then get him.
Everything stays as it is!
He isn't any friend of Father.
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
That's something I suppose.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
Something happens to my confidence.
A what?
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
The what?
It's suicide!
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
Not true.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
But is she, has...
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
What do you mean?
Now, what do you want?
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
How many weeks?
Just one.
What girls you got here?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Tod might know.
No.
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
Of Joanne's?
You know what I'm talking about.
'Sucking off.'
No.
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
Where does he live.
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
Andy.
Who's paying you?
In G.R.? Why?
That's like a stag film.
I don't know.
But the police...
Yeah. Probably.
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
Get out.
What are you doing here?
Yeah, sure.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
Just leave me alone.
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
Well...
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
It's an investment.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
Hold it, mister.
What's that?
What does that do?
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
Huh?
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
How long have you been driving?
No.
Officer, I can explain.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
A block of ice.
What do you see?
Here's your shovel.
I don't know.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Sort of.
All right.
Eh, fine.
Me! No. Of course not.
Yes. Very much.
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
What do you think?
You look as if you could.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
Look.
But what?
But we can't just dig it up!
Is he all right?
Thank you.
He's stopped.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
What was that?
Yes. They're old friends.
Do you think there is any life up there?
Maude.
Oh, Harold. 
... which I hope will make you very happy.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
I don't care what people say.
This is insane.
Would you like a cigarette?
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
Does that worry you?
I put a lot of effort into these things.
Well, maybe one.
Your studies?
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
Yes... Yes. You look...
And you're sure it was a woman?
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
Is he serious??
Remind me why I keep doing this.
See? I don't like that --
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
It's almost over!!
What the hell was that? An ape?
I thought you liked being on TV.
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
What took you so long?
What was that??
Goodnight, then.
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Just in time.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Julia!
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
Come to Daddy.
Oh.
There is going to BE a wedding?
Oh.  Oh yes.
What happened to you?
What do you want me to do.
Not know.
A long time.
And the blood let you out?
So where's the harm?
Maybe we should just leave --
Hi. I got soaked.
I have to see my father.
Just a thought --
It smells damp.
Where are you?
Why not?
Larry....
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Maybe a brandy.
What?
Drinking alone.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
Am I?
Where are you?
Well I want you to see the house.
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
Is Julia here?
I love you, honey.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
It's like she's waiting for something.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
I want to see.
Where are you going?
We're on the Cointreau.
It's not what I heard.
I've been better.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
I wanna date a musician...
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
My band.
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
Like fuck you are.
Sonic Death Monkey.
Great.  Can I have it then?
On Clark Street!
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
Your desert island top-five.
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Yeah, sure...
It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.
Great.
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
Rob --!
Can I do anything?
It's Vince and Justin.
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
Hi.
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Is it better?
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Is that why you wanted to see me?
You don't ever think about other people?
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
I'm sure.
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
I can't talk right now.
Do you want me to be there?
Yes, of course.
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
Want to know what, exactly?
To make you feel better.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
More confident, maybe.
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
I mean it.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
Not in love, exactly, but...
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Very persuasive.
Hey.  It's Liz.
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
You share a place with T-Bone?
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
I'll call you.
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Thirteen hundred.
Seventy-five.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
It's my birthday.
Why?
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
The boy _died_?
This is against the rules.
Do you play?
Good reflexes.
You?
No one knows you're here?
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
That would be difficult to explain.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
I didn't kill the watchman.
You killed those other two.
You kill with your left hand?
Don't.
Now there's a new topic.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
You and I should talk first.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
You are the same?
Does it change with me in the room?
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
I'm twenty-two.
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
What would you like?
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Any other I.D.s come up?
I don't know.
The last four.
Spare a chair?
Head still secure to the neck.
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
He found us even there.
Yes.
Your murder weapon?
My condolences.
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
What's the idea of locking this?
The poem?... The poem was great!
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.

But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
Mother? But your mother --
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Well, she'll know some day.
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Please! Will you just --
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
What now?
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
Exclusive? That's great.
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Hildy!
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
What did you do with her?
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
What's the matter with my brains?
How about Bruce's?
It'll be Heaven!
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Three bullets! Any good?
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
Where'd you get this?
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
That's murder!
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
What do you mean -- through?
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
What is it?
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Here!
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Mother!
That man there!
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Isn't that her picture?
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
What do you want?
Why not?
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
They wouldn't take it.
A very fine-looking women.
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
What's that?
But Grandpa, you said...
Only till they get you into the local school.
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
I don't mind.
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
Well, for the baby, really.
Who pays for them?
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
What about it?
And I'm still just a lad myself.
Has Sue got it right?
That's it.
When do you think you'll get leave again?
Don't be silly, Dawn.
The ideas you get in your head.
Out.
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
Molly!
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
You know... a couple of queers.
He walks, duh.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.
What are you doing!
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
Oh.
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
No please, let me sit this one out.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
Recover any bodies?
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
I don't know. I only saw one.
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
Plates match.
Tell him, Harold.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Gabrielle.
Oui.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Gabby, what is it?
Not in front of the boy.
Well, I think...
Well?
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
What do you mean?
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Oh?
And I think I'm going to.
Lila, it's Rosie.
How'd you know where I was?
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
My God! The fork! The fork!
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
You do?
I like you, too, Nathan.
Fifteen.
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Absolutely.
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
Come on.
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
What?
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
I've never been to Louisville.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
How?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
Hey, mister.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
What is?
Yeah. Sure, sure.
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
I told you. I got drunk.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Man named Turk Baker?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
Thinking about what?
Well, we won't.
I don't know.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
I'm a businessman, kid.
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
You name it, we shoot it.
The expensive kind.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
Talk to me, Charlie.
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
Is that what you think?
Findley.
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
You better not miss, friend.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
What time is it?
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
Okay. So what's your name today?
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
What are you writing?
He knows. A lot.
Well, he owns things.
I love you.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Yeah. That's right, too.
Very good shot.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
Yes.
Do you remember where you lived?
Who is this?
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
What do you want?
Bathroom?
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
Why, Dad?
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
... and Rigel.
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
May I ask why?
About what?
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
They'll get us.
Damn.
I have school.
It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
What's his family background?
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
Just my luck, no ice.
With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
Are you all right?
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
What the hell is this?
Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
This I can see.
Thanks, Pops.
With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
But what, General?
Your son.
So, what do you do for a living?
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
Yes.
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Many worlds...
Peace? No peace.
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
My reputation precedes me.
Venice, Italy!
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
The Word of God...
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
DONOVAN!
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
No?
This one. I think he's in here.
You came back for the book? Why?
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
Oh, it breaks the heart.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
How did you she was a Nazi?
So did I.
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Dad!
My Diary's in Berlin.
All right Dad -- tell me.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
The penitent man is humble before God.
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
I like Indiana.
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
I don't need camels.
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
Charming.
What?
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
Lao She.
You have insulted my son.
Step on it, Short Round!
Indy, look!
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
I like the service here.
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
He told me they knew I was coming here.
What do you mean -- how?
Don't let it curl around you!
Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
Oh really?
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
Primitive sexual practices?
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
I want to go home...
Figures...
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Who was it?
Me.
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
You've heard of the PEM114...
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
What are you doing?
Yep.
Behind us?
What's that?
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
I don't like the sound of that.
We have to get out of here.
Just walk down the hall?
What does it say.
A lab and equipment.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
What do we do?
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
You mean...just leave.
What about it?
They'll know who I am.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Eating sushi?
Beautiful!
You're beautiful..
She doesn't seem to understand.
But what's it look like?
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Which one is she?
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
You're doing great with her.
What if she says something important?
You got any books in there?
She's got the most beautiful...s
No. What will you do.
Bingo.
You found her.
Osaka?
Come on, she's getting away.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
...drink it.
I can't...
Door to the right. Get up and run.
He was with Gruner!
Probably.
You sure this will work?
He hung us up dry.
What exactly?
I can always flush you down the toilet.
She is beautiful.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
You just got a Mickey.
Doesn't matter.
I'm against it.
I knew you were trouble.
Rene?
PEM115!
You have nothing...
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
Bit expensive, sir.
It's just money.
Yes?
Al Viola.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
Oh...that's okay.
Thanks.
Oh....Sure.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
I feel fine.
I noticed you staring.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Is someone else here?
I can't do that?
It's not apparent.
...and sort of...disinterest.
You are.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
You're talking to me.
How often they come here?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
Joe! What happened to you?
Why did you leave?
Wanted to get to know you.
You seemed interesting.
Your friends, did they ask about me?
What did you tell them?
Last night?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
Why?
You know where he went?
Hiroshima.
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
I know the territory.
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
What?
What is it?
What does he know?
What's new?
I'll take some.
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
He's into kind of little cars, that...
Yes, baby?
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
Good.
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
No, I'm not...
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
How grave?
Why?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
You ready...?
Lowell?
Don't you have to be at the office?
Right now?
What's going on?
I'm doing an interview.
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
What are you and Mike going to do?
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Is it too late?
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
You eating with us?
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
Yeah.
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
How much would I get paid?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
The new place? New.
How'd you know that, Lowell?
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
You believe that?
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
She sued you for back payments of child support?
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Where you staying now?
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
They hate each other --
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Baby. You are so HOT!
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
What a touching story.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
It was a gift from a client.
Set one side for Bel Air.
We did not.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
Yes?
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
And here I thought my mother was...
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Fabric and fringe.
Hello Marylin.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
It's a no go, Joe.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
I was devastated. Of course.
Who's that?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Video.
And she has...?
What the hell is wrong with you?
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
How is she?
Mr. Warne?
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
You ought to know why. Because—
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
Oh, hello, Dad.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why—
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
Why? Do you know him? 
She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
You've made that quite evident—with all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
Oh, yeah?
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will.
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
What are you talking about?
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind. 
That, I suppose, makes everything—uh—quite all right.
Do you mind putting out the light?
Who are you?
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Like what?
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Nope. No complaints.
Must be the Spring.
Um. You're doing all right.
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
I'm following you.
Yes.
Not a one.
You're prejudiced.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
What's got into you?
I don't want it now.
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
Oh, no!
Amazing.
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
What happened?
What'd you give him for the car?
Congratulations.
Same to you.
You bet we did.
Whatever you say, darling.
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady—
Husband?
Why, he'll be back.
I'm hungry.
Up yonder. See the lights?
Yeah.
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Yeah.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
Send it collect.
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Yeah.
There's a seat over there for you.
I can use a smart guy like you.
Why—no—
Orange, New Jersey.
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
There were no phone records.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
I'm scared.
No, you don't!
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
I'm sorry.
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
Nonsense.  What next?
Honey, you all right? 
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
Huh?
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Yes.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
You have other information?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
How many men are working with you on this?
Yes?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
What are they?
I understand.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
You were there for me.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
And you didn't tell the Police?
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
What's she want?
I'm not a loser.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
I thought you might want a drink?
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
No, you didn't. What branch?
How many trips did you make?
Thanks, but I have my own now.
This is pretty.
Who is this?
Are you?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
My ass ain't the same.
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
How was it?
Does it happen to all men?
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
You do that?
Which one?
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Ray wants him.
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
Where're you going?
He say is a surprise.
What the fuck is that shit?
Was she there?
She didn't say.
You said that the last time.
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
I thought I did.
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
I have no idea.
I thought you were watching him.
He said he didn't know about it.
Keep it between us girls?
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
Thanks.
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
Baby, I didn't --
You told them that?
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
It's boring, isn't it?
Where at?
How long?
What for?
Bank robbery.
Want a Metrix?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
Were you a disco girl?
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
No.
I don't like dancing.
I lived there for about nine months.
Must of made quite an impression.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
He went to meet that stewardess.
And your point is?
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
Yeah, down the end.
As low as two.
I didn't look like a bum.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
Couldn't talk to her?
You know how she is.
How long was she in there?
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
What?
Watcha gonna see?
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
Ten thousand sounds high.
House.
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
What's up with this shit.
I thought you might be asleep.
How the fuck did he find me?
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
She's been there since Thursday night.
You expect me to just walk in there?
It's the next street.
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Where do you want to go?
It's all been a dream.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
Well, how do I look?
I'm okay.
Oh God!
Oh, terrific.
There's nothing to expose.
Maybe there's a larger truth.
Maybe the demons are real.
I'm hanging up.
Hey, wait!
Wait ... Daddy.
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
How long had that been going on?
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
What did she have to say?
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
What? By myself?
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
No.  I see them.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
What's your name?
I'm not cold.
Go to sleep.
They stole it.
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
What happened to you?
They're weird names.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
Yeah, but for what?
I must have been out of my head.
She looked good then.
What's wrong?
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
They weren't human!
It's gone to the top.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Help me! Help me!
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
Remember that.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
Please.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Sit down, Jake.
Sit down.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Why won't you answer me?
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
You can have anything you want.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Where have they gone?
WHO ARE YOU?
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
Just relax.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
Well that's good to know.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
No. I couldn't.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
We're doing everything we can.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
A long time.
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
Still married, Jake?
You can't talk in Brownsville?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
What's goin' on Paul?
I've seen them too ... the demons!
No one knows. They say it blew up.
Is he all right?
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
What's that?
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Everyone okay?
You're a teacher.
Not a chance.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
Rizzo?!
What's this?
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
I think I had some when I was eight.
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
Now what?
She needs a little time.
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
You killed him?
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
Kicker!
Leave him behind!
How do you know?
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
Jason? He's on this ship?!
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Son! -- Out of the water now!
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
Where...?
Did you get him in the head?
Can you stand something to eat?
You too, sweetheart...
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
She's right.
Why?
No, it was local jurisdiction.
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
Chum?
What is all this stuff?
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
You all right?
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him.
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
What do you see?
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
Coming right to us!
Jesus, Bleek.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
We're getting a stretch limo.
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
Huh?
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Did you hear it's yours?
I don't really know anything about it.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
Excuse me?
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
We don't even have a dog!
Wow, dream big!
What? My eyes are not lying!
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Blood and guts.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
Why aren't you at work?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
Yeah?
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
Hello?
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Is Vanessa here?
No?
But I thought you'd be cool if...
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
God, you're so young.
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
Is this Juno?
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Unfortunately, yes.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
She answered our prayers.
Hi, I'm Adele.
...I said, I like your hair.
Are you takin' the pictures?
What?
Where you from Walter?
This guy killed a mess of people.
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
...and?
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
Why, what did he do?
Carrie, watch for Early.
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
...Diebold?
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
Yes!
What do you think?
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
What do you want?
Probably.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
You are?
Casper! Was up kid?
Nothen' B.
You sure?
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
How do you know?
Yeah.
Because your a virgin?
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Hello.
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
The pain. The fucking pain!
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Yep.
Making love is like.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Oh shit.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
So that's why Casper is how he is.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
What are you guys doing?
Yeah.
I can't man.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
All you gotta do is look at the map.
No, I need the original note.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
You still having a problem with this?
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
What do you mean, stand out?
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
How?
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
Let me speak to my daughter.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
Very good.  How did you know?
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
What is it, dad?
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
Yeah.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
He's right, Kathy.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
Whatever's on your mind.
Are you one of the players?
When I was very young.
That's a very personal question.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
In a way.
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Of course.
I'm just curious.
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
Of course.
Why?
I know you didn't
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
Peter, you have to admit--
You're right.  The killer told me.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
You will go alone.
There is nothing.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Never.
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
You're coming with us.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
My <u>friend</u>.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
When did you last sleep, boy?
I'm not hungry.
You've eaten nothing.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
A venison pie as big as a house.
No.
I don't think it's working.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
It's a lie!
Yes. We lost five.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
Modred! Impossible!
Each to his fate, lad.
We had no children.
It is no trickery.
You lie!
You will come with me.
...You moved too, didn't you?
Yeah.
No, no.
Why can't I have a bank account?
130... 140...
How can you say it?
What?
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
...I'm going to kiss you.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
How many girlfriends did you have?
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
You say it just to calm me!
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
...Yes?
Huh? Why?
Messina.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
I don't accept that.
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
Nothing's going to happen.
Are you two planning kids?
Maybe later.
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
Thank you.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
Red flags man.
This guy's not a murderer.
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
I'm walking there Kris.
You're walking to California?
Come on Mr. Parker.
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
Where am I?
In a hospital.
Good morning.
I don't have kids.
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
What are my choices?
No alcohol?
No.
Coffee?
What's up?
Are you serious.
You OK?
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
About ready for another drink?
Yes? What?
I can't tell you.
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
You're fired. I have new representation.
Is he always such an ass?
It's so shameful...
What's going on?
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Where you got in the shower.
Is everything okay?
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
You're hitting on me?
What did you see when you entered the house?
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
Uh -- family.
The idiot speaks.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
Here. You're gonna need this.
Your scrunchie?
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
Did she do that to you, too?
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
And you know this for a fact?
The what?
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
Up for a celebration dinner?
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
Yes? Ms. Woods?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
I don't know --
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
That's not entirely --
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
No, silly. I go here.
You got into Harvard Law?
Now I am.
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
We watch... good fun...
Your love.
God protect me.
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
What was that?  Did you hear that?
We be honored, friend Ogg.
No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
I fear she's lost.
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Don't you care about what's happened?
There must be an answer somewhere.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
And who might that be?
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
Shhhh!
Aye!  That too.
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Beware.
Worse than the battlefield.
What know you of fields of war?
Nice piece of work.
God's blessing.
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
Wait, Jack.
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
Been telling you that all along, lad.
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Can't we move any faster?
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
He'll not escape me.
Where?
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
These for me?
What shall we do?
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
What?
Pinching?  Where?
As fair as me?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
No!
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
Do I not please you, Jack?
In every way.
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
Please...
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
Is he a friend, then?
Lost?
A castle's but stone and mortar --
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
Oh.
He hasn't called?
Why?
Alyssa.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
What did you think it would be?
Where's your dad?
He jumped into the ocean.
He's a freak.
Why are you so uptight?
I don't wanna go.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
He's at work while I'm here.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
Are you guys' friends?
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
What are you on?
Pardon me?
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Maybe...?
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
For everything.
Sam?
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
I forgot where I put my keys.
You don't have a choice.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
I don't know.
It'll be fine.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
I'm leaving.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
You're too fucking late.
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
I took some of your Vicodin.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
I know parts of who you are.
Are you talking?
To hide a black eye.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
She seemed upset.
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
I still don't know what that means.
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
Good for you.
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
What are you doing?
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
Four days.  I left to think.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
One of you would end up dead.
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
I drove over and you were gone.
It makes me sad.
Which?
What have you been before today?
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
It's been a while.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
Is your back still killing you?
No.  Mostly me.
Back.  Neck.  Back.
Are you going to kiss me?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
What's your deal with Alyssa?
Don't even...I'm there.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
That's the problem.
I've missed you guys.
The door was open.
All day again?
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
He's a big one.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
I'm talking about a haircut.
Not for me, it ain't.
She always said that if you were on the outside...
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
I've never seen you in here before.
I don't think so.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
What are they gonna do to us?
How would I get a loan, anyway?
Like this?
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
You're soft.
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
What are you talking about?
He even got my daddy's watch.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
What does that mean?
Forget it.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
Does that mean I'm in?
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
We'll just get off at the next stop.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
Let it go, Claude.
One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
That's the way it is.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
I'm not working on a plan.
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Back to New York for starters.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
I'm all right.
Made just for you, Cookie.
Move it out.
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
Wait for the firemen!
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
ADRIAN!
Let her go.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Is this a joke?
We could create our own hell there.
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
Release the evil?
I didn't murder anybody
This is baloney!
Everything's fine, pop.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
No. This can't be happening.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
You smell like coconuts.
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
You have a dog? What kind?
What were you thinking coming here?
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
I changed my mind.
Where did you get that?
And then you killed him, right?
I don't..
Uh-uh.
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
Will you take me with you?
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
Don't!
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
I'm sorry.
What do you mean by that?
What is?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
His or ours?
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
I want more.
You like it?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
You got him.
I don't. I don't know him.
What night is that?
What's up?
Where's Pete?
You talk to him?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
Yeah, Mack?
What's the matter?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
What is it?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
What's that?
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
I called, you know.
You're up early.
What the hell is going on?!
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
You like pornos?
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
I don't know.
It was weird...
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
Fossils.
Fossils, huh?
Sorry.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
Look here—
No kidding?
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
Just call me Barney.
—then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
Say, what about that gold deal?
Huh?
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
Goodness, no!
Who, for instance?
Oh, good heavens, no!
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
When was all this?
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
No porters here!!
Oh, I'm so glad.
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
How can we get in touch with them?
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Sondra Bizet.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Bob, these are all that are left.
What are these people?
Yes.
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
George, come back!
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
The clothes?
was saying—
Why, you - you— Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
Was this your idea?
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
I wonder.
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
I was just going to.
What is it?
Thank you.
The hell were you thinking?
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
And Goodwill Toward Man?
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--
Vayanse. You others, go on.
I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
I taught kindergarten.
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
And what's this ... ?
Looks like a train ticket.
Kay--
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
Nowhere.
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
And they're buying it?
Where's he making his big speech?
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
He'll turn around.
Agatha...
I can't.  I have to know.
The other two will die without me.
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
Try again.
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
I'm fine.
I go running down there.
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
Seventeen minutes.
Uh, sir...
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Sir?
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
She was looking right at me.
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
I wanted to.
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
You're talking about the precogs...
You say some of the children died?
I believe in that system...
You said they're destroyed.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
John?
He's dead, Lara.
Sean --
Precog Deja Vu...
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
We could have lunch together.
Raincheck?
So you haven't seen his apartment?
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
I don't get it. What do you do?
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
What the fuck was that about?
It's daytime.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
I feel weird asking him.
No coke tonight.  Right?
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
How could you let her see this?
But what about them?
5-5-1.
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
So, when's the drop.
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
Quick drop. In and out.
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
No.
He'll work it off.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
Take a few days --
A bad heart.
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Taken care of?
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
So, it was a draw.
I'll page you.
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
I like it.
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
I'll get the girl.
C'mon, man...
What the fuck is that supposed --
I mean, that's what I heard --
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
We're getting whacked.
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
We don't need guns.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
I want to leave right now.
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
The videos.
You strapped?
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
Good morning.
You're from LA, right?
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
No. What is it?
I call 'em wiggers.
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
Yeah.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
A black man playing big league ball is something.
I can't.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
I'm not made of glass.
I just want to sit here and be still.
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
If you want to tell me.
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Can I ask you something?
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
Get out.
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
The hell you are.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
I'm the man.
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
They talked about me like
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
[Where are you coming from?]
[South America.]
[Who pays you?]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[I want you.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[Don't lie to me!]
How does it affect you?
Yeah, right...
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Do you always sleep with him?
Did you sleep alright?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Why do you ask?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
What's so important in Los Angeles?
Could I stop you?
That's not a question.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
You got that right.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
[No. Why?]
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
Our child's safety is at stake.
It will be a hard break.
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
Two tourists who never went home.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
And they took that away.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
Hey, Herbie...
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
You want me to ride down with you?
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
Ufa!
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
Marty.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
Yes, I know.
I'd like that very much.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
You say something?
No, I'm not kidding.
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
Tommy...
You boys'll have to go to work early.
What are you going to do with him?
Don't you use olives?
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
What?
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
Never mind. Forget it.
Never heard of him.
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
Is that liquor?
Give us this day our daily...
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
You betcher ass, Dad.
I think I heard about that.
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
No, no, that one.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
They missed the boat.
Why can't you look at him?
He's coming to.
In the direction you want to go.
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
Yes, that's what I mean.
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
Can you make out what they're talking about?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going—
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
I guess so. Then what happened?
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
Wait a minute . . .
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room—under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
Hello! . . . Yeh?
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
It must be some kind of a gag.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Join the John Doe Club.
Yeah. It certainly is.
Well, I don't get it.
Well?
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut and—I'll eat him.
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot—you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
It's good to see you. Sit down.
Shh!
Is there a crowd in the street?
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
Hello, guys.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
Could I please have a little water?
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Tell me what's wrong.
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
I hate fucking Springfield.
What?!
Roper...
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
Satisfied?
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
Only at the very end.
What's the point of this?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
I don't really like to drink.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
No.
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
What did you see?
Why did he do it?
You know why I like the track?
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
There's your answer. He's smart.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
You worship yourself.
When?
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
Stay here, don't move.
Scottie...
A deeper level?
...the hell are you talking about?
Roper.
What?
Yes, I believe he has --
Why?
She said I have a son...
Because I took it out of your memory.
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
What's happening?
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
Take care.
Won't be time if he gets access --
You're jumping to conclusions.
Try harder.
Why?
That's right.
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
What did he tell you?
There was no need to kill her.
Then where is she?
Cleaning up a mess.
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
Don't know what you're talking about.
This.  No point to it.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Program name?
Ay, yi, yi, yi.  The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
Wow.  Sand.
... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...
It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
Where did it originate?
You okay?
That's the only way to the Monolith...
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
There goes the neighborhood.
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
What is THAT!
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
NINJA APE ZORD!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
But I've never served a day.
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
So what happened?
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
We could lose the deal!
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
Bastard didn't even show.
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
What's the matter?
Luciano.
Why? You're the innocent one.
Who'll make the rules?
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
No. We ain't even...
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
I'll handle the Boss.
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
We must be friends, Charlie.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Spare us.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
Best we got.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Monkeybone?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Back? You're sending me back?
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Why?
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piñata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
Who?
The ring...
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
What pictures?
I don't want to talk about it.
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
What's wrong?
Oh, I hope so, dear.
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
Really?
This way?
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Where's the Majority Leader?
It couldn't be.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
You play--left field.
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
Paine.
My friends?
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Have *you*?
My first name's--Clarissa.
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
He's batty!
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
Jeff for Senator.
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
The porter's got them. They're coming.
Will the Senator yield?
Yes, I was--
Ah, now, that's better.
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Certainly would, Joseph.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
No. What had you better--?
You *couldn't*?
Go ahead--punch.
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
Oh, just a day--
Tonight.
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
Have you always had to--work?
Since sixteen or so.
It hasn't been easy, has it?
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
No!
Lena.
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
That's--that's splendid.
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
I know that.
Susan!
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
You're the best nurse I can think of--
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
He's lost complete faith in me--
That's him. Let him in.
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
What do you think?
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
Jim, you don't have to--
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Deeds?
Who's that?
Pixilated.
No, no children.
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Are they true!
But they did take place?
What's that got to do with it?
Feel better now?
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
I enjoy it.
What are they going to do?
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
Yes, if it isn't too late.
Ready?
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
Let's just walk, okay?
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
Huh?
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
Sure.
Come on, come on!
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
You try it.
How's it going? Okay?
How is this, sir?
I wish you luck, sir.
Mr. Cedar!
Newspaperman?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Where?
All set.
How do you do.
Yes.
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Huh?
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
No, thanks.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Huh?
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
What're you talking about?
Oh, they insisted on following me.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
What about your knocking off for lunch?
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
We provide opera.
—my wife wanted me to tell you she—  —she prays for you every night.
No, I mean - about my client.
Your Honor—
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Binge?
That ought to be fun.
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
You mean—  —by the neck or something?
Tails tonight, sir?
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
What's that?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
Me, sir?
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
Me more than most.
Why are they ganging up against me?
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
Really? You think so?
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
Dr. Mumford.
Uh-huh.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Were you supposed to have a session?
But you do therapy?
Thank you.
What kind of doubts?
I don't want to hear any more today.
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
It's a thought I had.
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
Do you want to come in?
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
We've been talking about her, mostly.
What do you think's wrong with her?
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
I think it's like... inquisitive.
And the Brocketts?
...And?
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
Doc...
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Okay.
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
Don't need it.
We're going for a walk.
Ph.D., psychologist.
I think you know what I mean.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
And this is legitimate therapy?
Which thing?
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
I'm glad.
What do you mean, "in no time"?
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
It's my bit for the community.
What do you want me to see?
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What happened today?
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
Sounds like you have several.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Really?
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
That was a terrible thing.
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
Let's make us even, shall we?
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
Intestines.
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
And what did he say?
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
Fifty percent.
A bright good morning to all.
So who's the broad?
Every damn day.
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
No you're not.
I'm not?
Why would I do that?
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
I'm staying.
Got guts, lady.
Have you no respect for the dead?
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
But he's just a filthy criminal?
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
That looked rather painful.
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
Your mind is so slippery.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
Much less go outside.
But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Are you with me... or against me?
And the light goes out...
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Really?
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Who?
Why?
It's me.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
You drink too much.
How could I see him if he's invisible?
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
Are you coming or not?
So why don't you just tell her!
Firepower costs money.
Wow.
But... the silverware?
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
You did?
Do we have to?
Through there!
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
What do you mean?
Please...
I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
About 5,000 troops.
Any cannon?
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
Thank you, sir.
Four o'clock.
Why didn't you wake me then?
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Only Lisette?
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
Are you trying to insult me?
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
And you, are you in love with any one else?
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
What?
Yes, I wrote it.
You could hear them?
You mean you heard them making love?
Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Naw, I already ate.
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
What's the matter?
You see that?
You go first.
Wait.
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
You did all this for me?
What it smell like?
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
Are they still out there?
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Thanks for the help.
I got fired too.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
Get on.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
Debo!  Debo!
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
My back.
What's the matter?
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
What?
Uh, yes..
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
Can we go now?
Good luck.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
The gun...
I killed you.
Keep your voice down.
Let me talk to her again.
Don't you threaten me.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
Is that something precious?
Ready?
Will you promise me that?
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
Please...
What?
Oh, Jesus ...
Keep the change.
You're going to go see her.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
Hey!
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
A surprise?
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.
That's enough.
What gives?
No.
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
Yes! Yes!
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
Plan on a longer visit next time.
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
My, that fudge smells yummy!
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
Don't you hurt her!
I'll see to Pearl.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
What are you doing, boy?
What's taking you so long about it?
It -- she --
I don't know nothin'!
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
What's your name?
O no! Your turn!
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
No, Harry! I thought --
You were listening outside the parlor window.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
What do you want?
I been bad!
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
This man down at the Drugstore...
He never asked me for nothin'.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
Worked like a charm.
It's just a stupid cat.
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
No.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
No more fights.
When did you have a nightmare?
Bring me forty-five back.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
You feel it, though.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
Capitalistic methods...
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
Good evening, Your Highness.
We can wait.
Comrade.
A day.
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
Bad news?
We may have a chance.
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Business.
Confess what?
No visa.
Oh no. No visa.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
Is this what you call the "butler"?
Yes.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
Was that talkative?
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Room service speaking.
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
I didn't follow you.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
At what?
Why?
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Probably not.
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
I wish they had never met.
Not funny, huh?
You see I couldn't shout that.
A funny story?
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
No! No!
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
Did you win?
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Months, Swana.
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
I must ask you to leave.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Unfortunately.
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
We could check the tape again, sir.
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
I like it.  I like the idea.
It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
That's what they're doing.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
How is this national security?
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
... never complain, never explain, John ...
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
More light, chief?
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
... little Bobby.
Oh, my goodness ...
You'll win the nomination.
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
... as the old alliances crumble.
This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
How about Kissinger along with him?
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
I'll do it.  No more.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
Anything.
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
Won or lost?
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
The "crises"?
How'd you know I was here.
How's that?
How you been, Ellis?
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
You don't know what he thinks.
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
Uh-huh.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Hard to believe.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
Not word one.
Would you tell me if you had?
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
Believe you're right.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Yes sir.
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
Yessir.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
You gonna drive out there?
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
I can't plan your day.
I put it in, Mama.
No. But I gave my word.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
No. I found it.
Yeah.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
...You getting anything on this?
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
Yeah. I know where you're going.
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
I was just passin' the time.
Will there be anything else?
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
You live in that house behind the store?
You married into it.
You married into it.
Call it.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
You on all night?
Yessir.
Okay. We can stop that.
...I'm wondering...
Yes?
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
Yes sir. Two tours.
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
Sheriff, I don't...
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
Bad idea...
Junior year!
A woman can write a check.
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
Well, do something, then, damnit!
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
Umm, I don't think that...
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
That's my son! My son is dead!
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
I'd rather not...
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Oh, Betty --
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
It's all right.
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
What?
Are you and Larry happy?
All the time...
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
You never gave us a chance...
Lyla's very nice.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
I don't think your friend likes me.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Make sure it's elevated...
Yes.
Roy! What are you doing here?
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
He has no heartbeat!
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
The one you were telling me about?
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
He has a wife?!
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
What are those for?
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
You should have a little faith in people.
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
What?! That you had something to do with it?
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
Could you give us an example?
That is so right.
Now, that's really stupid.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
I wanted to make a statement.
...that's a good motto.
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
Betty, Betty, Betty...
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
We should go.
You need to remember who you're talking to...
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
It just didn't fit her profile...
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
Oh, five years, give or take.
I don't know, George...
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
Devil his due.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Vernon Waldrip.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
You said -
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Don't I know it.
Who was fixing to betray us!
A million dollars.
It was a moment a weakness!
But...
Pete... I do apologize.
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
It was a powerful air.
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Daddy!
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
I want your D.O.R.
I want to fly, sir!
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
You're good.
What did you call me?
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
No, sir.
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
And you turned him down??
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
There's always a choice.
You're better than candy.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
Does it still hurt?
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
I'm looking for Sid.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
I'd like to come with you.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
That isn't true, is it?
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
He said open it.
They're not supposed to be here!
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
Open it.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
'Bout four o'clock.
What do you want?
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
Watch your mouth.
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
Something's weird.
Fuck him.
What?!
Can't hear a thing.
What do we do?
Yeah.
Are you freaking out?
I am.  I'm here.
Stop it.
Not an option.
Uhh... I with it sister but...
Alma I told you to...
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Who's they?
Who? I mean besides the FBI?
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
Jesus...
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
Huey man I got to talk with you...
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
I don't know about that.
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
Ain't no one seen him.
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Congratulations.
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
That would be nice.
I expect to try.
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
You don't know him very well, do you?
You look well, Charlotte.
You're surrendering.
My pleasure, sir.
Colonel will do.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
That one is a bit more difficult.
Their names, ranks and posts?
Are you going to meet with him?
And if I triumph, you triumph.
Do you see that, Colonel?
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
You're in no condition to ride.
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
Is it?
Where?
Don't go in there.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
Long time.
Don't touch him.
How many men have we seen die?
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
Father... I killed those men...
Who might you be, little Miss?
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
Huh?
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
I can hardly read these.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Does she love the cat?
Is there quicksand?
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
Rachel not feeling well?
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
She's finally asleep.
I just said--
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
What -- you don't have the medallion?
Do you believe him?
Then why aren't you eating?
Boy overboard!
Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
Difficult ... to say.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
Me!
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
You cheated.
Move!
It's still against the law.
That's not true.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Jack!
Yes.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
As you can see I am a new man, just like you.
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
Oh no?  Smell this.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
Well, you got another problem.
There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel!  Do you understand that?
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
You're insane.
Daniel, give him the Trix.
Mouse?  What mouse?
You don't know?
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
Why?
Three days ago it was.
What's that supposed to mean?
What did you want my hair for?
No cheese.
You made this out of my hair?
We've got to get the nanobot.
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
And you have him?
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and — 
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
Oh, Mother!
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot—
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
I poisoned him.
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
What's the idea, Anne?
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
—and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
What is this person doing here?
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Ah-ah-ah!
I knew your managing editor very well.
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
Yeah, little Gloria.
Well - it's only April.
Dawson, sir.
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
I beg your pardon, sir?
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Yes.
I bet.
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
It's the smoke.
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
Staring at us?
Hello, Stew.
Okay.
How far have you gotten?
Did who?
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
I think you'd better go.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
Holy jumping swordfish!
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
I beg your pardon.
Are the cars ready?
Smythe, you've been drinking.
I beg your pardon?
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe—
Did you call, sir?
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Yes sir.
A bird in a gilded cage?
Does it look okay?
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
No she's not.
What is that?
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
I told you, George. I'm not going.
But where would we go?
Sure is pretty.
It's better, Mary Sue.
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
Oh, no thanks ...
It's like the basketball team.
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
It's not in ME.
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
You know him?
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
I could like kill a guy with these things.
Jen please ...
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
You're reading?
Sure.
You got the admissions letter.
Hi.
Oh ... Hi.
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
What do we do?
... Her father.
McGinty's.
EXCUSE ME?
Why don't you just take me back without it?
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
Bud ...
You know what I really like?
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
It's beautiful.
TV repair.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
No, no, no.
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
Why?
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
I'm trying to be your friend.
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
What's all this pudding?
Why's it here?
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Where are you?
Do you like porno movies?
...yeah.....
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
I'm going to work.
Really? Please?
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
So you think you can?
I know I did. But I don't.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
No.
I don't know.
Not very well.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Hi.
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
Sure.
....Hi.....
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
Yeah?
What did he want?
Did something happen; are you alright?
What?
...yes I did...?
Are you learning how to play it?
I'll see you later.
I don't freak out.
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
...what...?
For work.....
Can I come home with you when we get there?
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
On my knife.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
I didn't do it.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
Hi, is this your first time calling?
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
Who is this?
That's that.
I didn't know you had a sister?
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
You ok?
Why you wearin' a suit?
Good morning, Barry....
You're goin' on a trip?
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
Hey.
I need to talk to you for a second.
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
You have an ATM?
I know.
You can't just stay in your house.
I'll see you there.
I thought Latisha said you would --
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
It's not bad, it's ok.
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
We should be going --
It's fine.
Should I call you later?
At your service, Count.
Madeleine --
Has he hurt you?
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
Free his mouth.
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
Good day, Marquis.
-- water! --
I saw the longing in your eye --
Who's to say I did not?
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
Shut down?
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
There's something else I want from you.
Is it terribly erotic?
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
I am not a wealthy woman.
Oh, but I am!
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
God, these parties are the worst
Randolph!
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
Marion--
I will not defend my life to you--
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
We're using-
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
He personally asked you to?
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
Oh for Christ's sake-
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
Listen to me-
I'll hire you  -- right now-
How?
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
What?
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
Craig is one syllable
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
Well, at least she's off KANE today
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
You gonna watch?
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
Yes.
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
You're going to destroy it
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
Then find another theater
For Christ's sake, shut up--
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
I'm Christ
All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
What's up, Colonel?
What who's been sayin'?
This looks done.
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
Yeah --
Go 'head.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
Yeah, she's nice.
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
Except fall down like a normal person.
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
Screw you, Jack.
How's that?
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
So what?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
What time is it?
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Now take the rest off.
Nobody. I love you, remember?
You did?
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
No, not that.
But they don't have a case against you.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
He should.
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
For instance?
If possible -- both.
A detective's nightmare.
Ever get an answer?
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
That depends on who "they" were.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
Read some good books.
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
Who are you?
No.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
Lisa Fremont.
I'm not ready for marriage.
She's only perfect.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
Keep your mind off her.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
Isn't he a salesman?
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
Huh?
You called the police?
You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --
What?
You can tell that from here?
Got a shovel?
Mrs. Doyle?
What would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
I wish there was one I wanted.
You mean leave the magazine?
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Homework. It's more interesting.
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
No comment.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
What's the apartment house number?
Women aren't that unpredictable.
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Still -- those witnesses.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
That's a suitcase?
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
But you're not?
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
L. B. Jefferies.
Phone number?
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Where can we meet?
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
What time is it?
Hang loose.  We got all night.
Shoot, Jimbo.
Is there some kind of trick answer?
Go ahead.
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
You sure?
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.
Hi there.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
Are you really going to meet them?
What?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Who's that!
It's me!
Judy.
Hey where'd you go?
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
I need it.
I shot at one of them.
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
I'm sorry.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
No.
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
He called me chicken.
What?
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
See?
See, I'm new.
The kids take me.
Goodbye!  See you!
They'll be looking for you.
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
You were looking for me, weren't you?
You still pretty upset?
No.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
You don't need to do that.
What?
So do you.
I never felt so clean before.
Is he your friend?
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
Good evening.
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
He wants... your "sister"...
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
No --
No, c'mon --
Tell me again.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
You need a COAT!
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
NO!
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
You told him about Nick's letters.
No, Nick, no --
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
I don't know...
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
You... you... YOU --
I saved your life.
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
Who are you now.
Yes!
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
Samantha.
Her brother.
I said, who the hell made the map?
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
Nnn... nothing...
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
No way.
No gun.
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
The Powwow Safe?
Fuckin' freezing.
I'm just saying.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
Rudy, don't move --
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Ash... Ashley...
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
That was my king!
How ya doin', Toothpick?
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
How can you tell?
Me and Mr. White?
What?
I gotta memorize all this shit?
Tell me more about Cabot.
Mr. Brown?
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
What's that?
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
That's your proof?
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
What's this guy's problem?
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
As opposed to good?
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
Want a smoke?
Uh-uh, just cops.
I got 'em, all right?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Why!
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
We don't think this place is safe.
Maybe he did.
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
Tell them to come on in.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
Hold on.
He knows his alphabet.
What?
All my clothes --
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
I -- lost something.
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
How does she draw?
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
Where'd they go?
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Can I have my gun back?
Yeah, it does.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
Go on, hit me.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
Is that the only reason you came back?
Sure. What other reason would there be?
How's that?
I said I didn't care.
Don't act so -- crazy.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
How do you know who we are?
Clay Phillips.
What for?
Because there's a man I want to see.
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
Good night, Miss Wells.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
But you're his brother.
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
I found a picture of his wife.
That's it.
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Ouch!!
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
Maybe we can study together or something.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Cindy, let me...
Look, what I'm trying to say --
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
It's okay.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
Noooo!!!
Father!
Yes, we made it!
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
Let me help you.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
Right. What about condoms?
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Alright... I might need your help.
My help?
You're not wearing a belt.
Because she will lie?
What?
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
This part removes the sense of humor.
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
Hi, Mom.
What happened?
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Carl's a jerk!
You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
But Mom, the video's not over.
CHIP!!
No woman would!
Don't I get a kiss?
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
"P" as in...
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
He killed people, Mom.
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Beverly, are you alright?
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
What is it, Betty?
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Where?
Let's get out of here.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
How much have you got?
Why, Mary --
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
What were you talking about?
Yes, of course —— but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
A job?
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you -— you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister —— whom I had lost and have found again....   
But I'm not joking.
Do you think he knows about this?
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
You'll be all right?
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
What a peculiar question.
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
Tell me what?
Cloven hoof?
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
Would you mind?
So what about kids?
You're what?
Impotent.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
Of course not.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
All of these are interviews?
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
She said it on her tape.
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
Tell me your name.
Sometimes. Afterward.
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
Have you fantasized about me?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
Yes.
Don't you get lonely?
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
You're really never going to make love again?
But I don't understand --
No.
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Why not?
I want to touch you.
Graham...
Something wrong?
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
I want out of this marriage.
God damn you!!
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
Yeah, I know.
I take it you've never masturbated?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
No, I haven't.
Did you find him attractive?
I guess.
Yes.
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
What?
Why not?
Did he touch you?
You are in serious trouble.
It looks like a tablecloth.
Thank you.
No, I touched me.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
Nope. I think the man is a liar.
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
No.
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
When I was fourteen.
Very much live.
Is that what he tells you?
No.
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
I would.
I've got to get back to the office.
I want to see you.
What's so stupid about it?
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
Why not?
You trust him.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
John Millaney.
Yeah.
Hi.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Sure.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Anything wrong?
OK. But late.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Did I say anything?
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
That you, Rog?
I don't get it.
He didn't make it.
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
What's cookin', Bert?
I got it!  I got it!!!
Introduce yourselves.
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
How did you come by this scenario?
Why Janet?
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
AN' YOU'RE A WEEPER AND A WAILER ALWAYS TREADING THE TOES OF THE GREAT GENERALLY SPREADING YOUR WEIGHT YOU'RE A SPITEFUL, HATEFUL ASININE CREATURE A PUPIL WITH NO SCRUPLES WHO KNEW BETTER THAN THE TEACHER
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
Absolutely correct.
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
I NEED SOME
BRAD!
Our speciality.
That's an extremely negative response.
WHAT A JOKE...
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
We love you, Baby.
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
I love you.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
What are you pouring tonight?
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
I can explain.
Don't open that now. It's warm.
And?
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
Huh.
When do we get to drink it?
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
It does. Feels right.
You know that chick?
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Perfect.
How do you know?
Beautiful.
What do you think?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
We're on.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
Aye-aye, captain.
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Later.
Right now.
Hey, there you are.
Where is Stephanie?
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What?
Besides what?
Could be anything.
Obsessively.
Huh.
I don't want to talk about it.
With Maya.
I said okay?
You have to tell me --
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
Thanks.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
That's five clicks, Jackson.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Love you, man.
Maya, how are you?
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Yeah, weird. But great.
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
What about me?
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
About two-thirty.
Victoria.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
Oops. Sorry.
A hair.
The same windows.
I don't want you to die.
I'm scared.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
...Tell Graham --
And tell Merrill to swing away.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
Five. The five longest.
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
It was very dark.
Pharmacy crowded?
Yes.
No.
Dad.
They'll read our minds!
It's the strangest thing Father.
What's that?
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
Is anything missing?
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
It's like War of the Worlds.
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
I almost didn't.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
I already did that.
Where's the pinto going?
They got a saloon there?
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
Where you been?
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
You own this land.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
Never will again.
Believe it.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
Get out of here, Jake.
Howdy.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
What makes you think I could?
Why him?
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
It's the only place I'm happy.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
Where's the dog now?
Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
I can't wait to meet her.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
She'll drive herself.
I'll send you her resume.
What about it?
Even the fall from the plane.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
Excuse me?  Start?
... Simone.
As a matter-of-fact I am.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
Thank Simone for the tickets.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
So you did meet her?
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
Do what you do to Simone.
Yes, call me Simone.
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
There's... a wall between you --
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
What's that?
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
Why?
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
I love you, Lainey.
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
No, that was me.
-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
What?!
It's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
The background is.
I'm keeping it in trust.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Long live the First Amendment.
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
But that's Simone's part.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
A star is...
You mean they buy it?
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
You said the "s" word.
Something I want?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
Dr. Crowe.
No.
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
Yes?
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
Something happened, didn't it?
Yes, it did.
No.
I wish I were somewhere else.
You know that accident up there?
Cole, you're scaring me.
That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
I don't like people looking at me like that.
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
I happen to be a professional.
Hi.
Suzie???
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
No shit.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
Curt Cobain.
He means moon shining.
Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
People say he was a murderer.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
What's wrong?
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
You wouldn't understand.
Mac... let's get out of here.
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
Grant, where'd you go?
He tried to kill you, Starla.
That wasn't a good night, no.
Looks like a chipmunk.
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Meat.
Sure thing, killer.
It's just a work thing.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
A what?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Is this fun?
Driving, talking to me...
I give up.
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
I would've come back for you.
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
What kind of a guy is he?
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
No.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
No.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
What's that, pardner?
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
He's giving them up?
Did he give you his name?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
No, what did you say on the machine?
I could have it sent out...
...I'm sorry...
Without peer?
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
I can't discuss --
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
I'm working on it.
True?
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
What's wrong?
What do you want?
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
No?  Who am I, then?
Why would you let her to do that?
Who was it?
And professionally?
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
Not necessarily.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Just get him to stop.
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
And tonight?
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
What happened?
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
What happened to us, exactly?
Why did you say those things?
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
I think so.
Can you sleep?
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
No.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Thank you.
You never said you wanted one.
I never said I didn't.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
I want to stop taking those pills.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
I can't --
Claire!
Looks a little constipated to me.
Hi.
Right.  That's true.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
They're kind of fuzzy.
So, this could be your last night, huh?
What's to like?
You asked.
Yeah.
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
Do you dance?
Everyone's all right...?
Keep what handy?
Nothing.
Tommy...!
What?
What are you talking about?
You got no idea...
Hey.  The neighbors.
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
Bought it.
I'm sorry.
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
Even Joey Venza?!
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
Let my kid go.
How do you know where the gun is?
She's taking singing lessons.
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
What, want a glass?
No, no.
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
Harry…
Jesus Christ.
You get mugged or something?
Now tell me you love me.
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Mr. Jameson--
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Are you quite finished?
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
What if you get hurt?
I hate--
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
Toxic dumps, huh.
Yes.  Do you have a date?
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
Absolutely no class.
Aunt May, what happened?
How is he?
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering… the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron…
Actually, I got this spider bite…
Need any more help?
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
Where'd you get the clown suit?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Jawohl.
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Any news on Dunbar?
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
I'll live.
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
You are being rude again.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Jawohl.
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
You can say that again!
No, Animal.
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
You'll fix me up!
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
That's what I wanna hear.
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
You starting that again?
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
What did you say?
December seventh, forty-one.
Who's the guy, Schulz?
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
This is me in Cincinnati.
Where is he now?
Captain=8A
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Is she still angry?
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
No, I didn't know that.
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
You must think I'm quite the madman.
Trilithium?
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Aye, sir.
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
Still no response, sir.
Locate.
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
... Fascinating.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
I'll go...
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
... A cloaking device?
About a dozen officers and men.
Close... There --
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
Yes, I was...
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... Spock...
Yes... But -- how...?
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
What about Spock?
So!  Speak!
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
It never rains but when it pours --
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
Khan could be down there!
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
Wait --
Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
David. Please.
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
The Admiral's son.
Don't you believe it.
Listen to me -- you men and women --
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
Try the emergency channels...
On screen.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
Yes, Spock.
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
The power of creation --
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Not enough against their shields.
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
I did not think so.
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
How?
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Power levels quite low, sir.
After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.
Admiral on the bridge!
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Stop engines.
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
We are clear and free to navigate.
He's not what I expected, Sir.
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
Humans make illogical decisions...
Heard there was some excitement.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
What do you mean?
Bones, stay here.
We've done it before.
It doesn't look all that different.
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
... I don't think he understands...
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
My name?
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
Yes, sir.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
Status report, Admiral!
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
Or believe, I'll bet.
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
Just lucky, I guess.
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Permission to come aboard.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
How do you know this...?
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
Status?
The tank will be finished by morning...
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
The explosive override -- ?
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
... Yes?
Transparent aluminum?
Right on. You fly?
Father...?
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
Really.
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
Can he breathe under water?
And our people?
Will he live?
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
You're not finished here?
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
A planet in Federation space...
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
Do you know how to disable the injector?
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
Can you beam him off?
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
You haven't done that in a long time...
No children?
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
Absolutely.
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
You think they're still up there?
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
I have helm control.
I am the Borg.
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
What did you do to the batteries?
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Entering the upper ionospere...
Ready.
Great name. French?
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
There is no invasion...
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
I can try.
Some.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
That's impossible.
Return to our own time?
Yes, sir.
We have to stop them from sending that message.
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
They're bypassing Engineering...
I believe the operation is over.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
And what did they tell you?
You were demoted...
Yes.
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
Me?
They're dying.
What is it?
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
Close enough to beam down?
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
You must have faith.
A lie?
Any progress?
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
Nevertheless.
What exactly does that mean?
Because you are dangerous.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
It'll only work for one of us.
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
Yes.
What purpose does this serve?
May I have this dance?
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
How could I not?
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
How can you be certain?
Imzadi. This is so good.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.

Open a channel.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Sir?
How long until he can fire?
You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.
I'll take care of it, sir.
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
That will never happen.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
Sir --
It's working.
But she's not the Enterprise.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
What's this all about?
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
I won't defend my life to you.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
It’s too late.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
The bond is broken.
Find her again.
How long until we reach the Rift?
And?
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
Praetor.
You have one with two beds?
Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
Do you have children?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Where did you stop last?
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
Shermin...
Please...
Which way?
Smile.
Yes.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
Yes.
Why?
The driver will...
You want this ticket?
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Yes.
It's bad.
Yes.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
You can have one.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
Where did you learn that?
I can't stay on this planet.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
You don't forget anything, do you?
Do they talk?!
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
You sure this is your car?
What? No, of course not.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
Doesn't make sense.
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
I wouldn't think so.
It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
What?  Right Here?
Thanks, Max.
That's not sayin' much.
You were lucky, Max.
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
He's been cooked-off
What stuff?
Where's Faith?
You just did.
Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Are we having a bad night?
No, you're just trying to get off.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Jesus, Lenny.
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
No more, Lenny.
See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
No it doesn't.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
I guess.
Take it to him.
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
What are you...?
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Do you think he singled you out?
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
What I do requires confidentiality.
I'm hesitant to...
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
Huh?, sir.
Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Miss me, Dave?
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
This is a sexy case.
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
The man knew how to dress.
The other reason?
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
Don't be too harsh.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
It's a no-no.
Suspect Zero.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
Who are you?
He's moved on to TV.
What was your weakness, sir?
You? You went by the book?
Yeah.
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
I don't...
You have to put things in perspective.
You've been through worse.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
You like laughing at the misery of others?
...maybe...
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
...And she's with someone else.
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
...Which one...?
...well, it suits you...
...Six months.
Good.  I think about things.
I thought you met someone else.
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
I don't talk about her that much.
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
What's the point?
Uuuuugh!
I'm such an asshole.
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
Make someone bleed.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
Not well.
What are they doing here?
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Mike?
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
That's right.
What are you talking about? Vegas?
VEGAS.
What Vegas?
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
What?!?
Yea, how much?
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
Nice, baby.
We didn't do so bad after all.
Christy was nice...
Yeah, a good friend.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
How?
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
I'm sorry.
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
What a surprise...
You think?
...we're not...
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
It's on...
Good.  He never doubted you.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
An eye for an eye!
Godfather.
Godfather!
What was that?
Eat it, it's on the table.
You heard about your father?
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
No.
And with prison record.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
You mean Tattaglia.
Barzini.
No.
Then why have I become a man like you?
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
Hey, beautiful girls!
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
Who are those girls?
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
What was that?
Will you give this letter to Michael.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Hello.  Kay?
Can I go to the hospital with you?
I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
Just be patient.
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
You just woke up!
Is that good?
I don't like you.
You know, a primer.
What? What's this?
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I'm never going back!
I love jazz.
Your parents met her.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
That's good.
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
Frederico!
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
I told you! I knew it!
How would you know that?
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
Emily.  Just kidding.
How did you know that?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
So -- are you travelling under R?
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
We'll be there.
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
My God.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
All kinds of things. Making plans.
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
You got a .44 Magnum?
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Is there a firing range around?
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Why?
I can believe that.
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
The DMZ?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
You forgot "sexy".
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
20 bucks?
A girl needs protection.
Easy.
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Well, you want to or not?
Who's a killer?
You a narc?
Do I look like a narc?
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
You don't have to.
Why should it be grounded?
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
How's your driving record?
Education?
Some. Here and there.
Well then check back tomorrow.
Oh?
Sure.
Your name Sport?
Get it.
Real down.
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Could we change the subject?
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
You suppose?
I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
Womack ripped it up, right?
You knew?  All this time?
I believe you.
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
I see you got the telegram.
... including me.  Right?  
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
Me too.
It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
Nothing.  
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
Huh.  That was nice of me.
What... do you remember?
Sir, that is true.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
I'm a little hesitant to say.
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
Thanks.
Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
Nine and-a-half years ago.
Who... are they?
This is the staff of the Bijou.
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
But I...
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Zackly.
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Sandra Sinclair.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
Jesus.
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
Huh?
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
So, it is a blacklist.
That's not the country Luke fought for.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
Why not?
So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
That's my r-r-rent.
It's about me.
Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Thank you.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Then why did she object to you?
She already has a daughter.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
Is anyone there?
Look.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Yes, I did.
I don't think your mother would like that.
I know.
I wonder if you could help me.
Do you know him?
See them two big trees across there?
That's where the Brenners live.
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
I wonder if you could tell me...
I need her exact name, you see.
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
That's a chance we have to take.
If they are?
I started to say... inside...
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
Shhhh. Shhhh.
Not by the thousands.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
Monday?
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Sixty...  Oh.
I wonder if you could help me.
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
What's that?
Do you practice here?
What kind of law?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
You like me, huh?
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Yes, but...
Famished.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
But you tore it up.
Why?
You have a job?
What do you do?
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
It's an uprising.
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Take wing!
After the gulls attacked.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
How soon?
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
How?
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
I'm Donald Fettes.
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
You must leave this house.
I'm cold as ice.
Where can I find him?
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
But this woman -- and her son --
But you did promise.
Gray killed her.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
See that, Fettes?
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
I've drunk enough tonight.
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
But where did they get those people?
"A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like."  Ah, how he cozened them.
Any attacks of pain since?
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
Crony indeed!
I'm looking for my friends.
We won't.
The strip joint?
I think we should get some support?
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
I heard you were looking for this.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
You killed that cop Dutton.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
It's ok, it's ok...
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
About you.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
You wrote this?
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
Tell me what?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
How does he explain that?
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
You must have come a long way.
The present situation?
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
Thank you... Have you any news?
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
Well, we could--
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
Why not?
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
I'm sorry.
Is it worth anything?
Would you like to sell it?
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
Can't stand light?
Yeah.
We don't ride with vampires.
They're looking at us.
We were gonna grab some food.
What?...
I'm my own man.
Where is she?!
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
David.
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
You have a T.V.?
Thanks, Grandpa...
I thought we were goin' into town.
Hi... I'm Laddie.
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
You didn't tell David?
See you later.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Okay?
Ocean air!
Sam.  Is everything all right?
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
Something the matter?
Hi...
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
I know, I've felt it...
Take laddie.
Huh?
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
Where are we going?
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
What??
Where these tracks headed?
What was he doing in the rec room?
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Watch Clark.
What?
What?
Let go of me...
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
Childs!  That a fuse?
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
You ain't tying me up.
We should have jumped his ass.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
A couple of hours.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
Right.  Why not?
Put that down!
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
We should sleep in shifts.
Yeah!
It's the generator I think!  No power.
What do you do on the towers?
Ah... no.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
Sir... have you a name?
End...?
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
Say I just come back again?
So you take their best...
I know.
It's spectacular...
You know I can't.
A moonstone.
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
Heavens, look at that now!
I was not.
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
I've been working.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
I know that --
Why don't you come to our house instead?
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
Why not?
I don't understand.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Yes.
It's undamaged?
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
I see.
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
New Yorkers.
I am the oldest.
How did you get hurt?
Kalen...
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
Sir?
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
And what's that?
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
What're those?
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
Yeah.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
No, he didn't.
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
What case?
[Beat] I don't know.
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
Well, what time is it?
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
What about the world?
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
What are you talking about?
Don't you go to jail for that?
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
I'm not sure.
Yup. That's me.
You don't think that's crazy?
What.
Honey?
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
In the leg.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Did you get married real young?
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
What the fuck is going on?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Call me back.
Who did it?
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
Louise?  Where are we?
Whaddo we do?
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
This is so beautiful.
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
You do?
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
We can live in a hacienda.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
You're a good friend.
Go.
Say you're sorry.
Hi!
The thing's kind of heavy.
No harm, no foul?
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Well why don't you look her up?
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Mary's a babe!
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
We're in love with your roommate.
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Don't you want to know my name?
I work with retards.
How about -- ?
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Jai alai?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
No I'm not.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
Oh yeah. Fine.
Ted, are you okay?
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
But but what about Steve?
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
Is it the frank or the beans?
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Piggyback ride.
Franks and beans!
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
Yes, sir.
There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
Jesus...
Then they should speak up.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
Yeah.
How long until the army is ready?
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Dean Rusk!
I don't care. Cancel it.
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Hello?
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Mr. Clear Moon.
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
Couldn't sleep.
Her oil pan is shot.
Thanks, Cooch.
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
What?!
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
Why does he wanna see me?
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Cuz you're a cop.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
What?
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
So they took care of Leo.
This Jimmy's?
X21, give me a 20.
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
Come back?
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
Two miles.
Apology acknowledged.
I'm special.
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
Used to what?
Anything.
It's not suffering anymore.
And now?
Why?
Food...and you...my F-14!
That's what you get flight pay for.
Not to me.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
What do you want?
You don't believe that.
How do you play reality.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
Off me or off you?
That's three.
Who's gonna win?
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Yes sir.
Remember one thing.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
No! Not again!
280, 290, 300 knots.
The plane is fine.
Well what?
Let me do the talking.
On what?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
So's my Johnson.
No shit. The Iceman....
Come on, relax...
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Mav's a great flyer but....
Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
Who's the hell is that?
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
Why?
No bother.
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
I don't know...
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
What to the rebels want?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Shut up and drive!
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
Fuck you.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
He had help.  From our side, sir.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
Sleazy...and demure.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
They sell fake memories.
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Would you please repeat the destination?
Mmmm.....
Who?
Let me go!
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Lori, move.
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
You went to those brain butchers?!
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
Clever girl.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
All right.
What's he talking about?
I thought you didn't like me.
Not bad, for a hooker.
What reactor?!
No problem.
Yeah, still got one poking around.
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
Burt, can you hear me now?
She's got my vote.
BACK OFF, BURT...!
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
Howdy, Rhonda.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
You're hung up again.
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
Son of a bitch!
You go north, I'll go south.
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Use the fucking bomb!
Yeah, Val.
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
And I appreciate it.
Twenty.
What's it doing?
From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it?
That-a-boy. Hospital.
True.
It most certainly is.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
I have to talk to your brother.
"We"?
I didn't take my eyes off it!
You see that? You wanna be like that?
No. No...
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
I specialize, Roger...
I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.
Uh, Eddie? The, um, ballistics guy, George...? He called, and...  His tests show that Shu's gun fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin.
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
...For ten years, now.
Stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward, Kitty. Y'oughta start looking for the others...
A fucking wheelchair?
Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
My mother find you?
I killed the motherfucker.
We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
You getting this?
Yeah, we do some of that.
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
The phone company was broken up.
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Get lost Bobby.
The stuff we got last night.
An old woman and her grandson.
Can you tell me what their names were?
Yes...
Ever see her with someone else?
No.
How come Jack let's you work here?
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
What happened to her?
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
A blue rose.
Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
What is it?
You better dust this place, Sam.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
Are you going to see James tonight?
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
Bob.
But Bob isn't real.
No... No...
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
I've got to see you.
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
I can't tonight.
Laura.
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
I always thought you knew it was me.
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
How did you settle on the amount?
...yes. Get her on the phone...
No.
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Ed Concannon.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.  It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
Yes.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?
And you wrote that...
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Dr. Gruber...
I read the hospital report on your client.
Right. Who called?
Her doctors killed her.
Thank you...
A single hour.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
...things change.
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Laura.
I've got to work.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
And what makes you so tough?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
Missus...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
No.
Who are you protecting, then?
Then why don't you testify?
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.
Uh...
I have to talk to you.
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Admittance form is wrong.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Right.
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
What happened, Joey...?
Yeah. I'm awake.
The Doctors.
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
...yeah... good...
In New York?
As I've said we had some more...
What happened in those three...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Yes.
Huh. And why is that?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Huh.
We'd be in all the papers!
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
Aw, he isn't that good...!
It's gone now.
Don't you live at home?
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
They've blocked it!
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
One of mom's cups got broken.
What if it isn't over?
Guess so.
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
No.
Diabetes?
This is going to give you nightmares.
Who?
And...what's the man doing?
Dylan, where's the man?
What...what is that?
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
Yeah...how'd you know?
I've never mentioned it to him.
What are you talking about?
The car's no there yet?
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
What?
Come in.
Carry on.
Why didn't you drop any sail?
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
You're not a moron.
I just can't believe it.
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
Me either.
That's not why he's sending me.
But that's not the point...
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
So... What happened?
What'd you do?
It was so real...
Of a fight he can't win out here.
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
No.
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
You're officer of the watch, George.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
Don't ever call me stupid.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
It's outta here!
Do you have something to say?
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
I'm not gonna kill it.
I'm sorry...
I can't.
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
They are much more than that, sir.
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
Easy for you to say.
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
No, haven't heard of it.
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Ready for another?
What's that?
Whattaya mean family?
When did you talk to Lula?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
She really say she was pregnant?
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
Have now.
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
That is my permiso.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
Hasta siempre.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
What is it, Johnnie?
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
You won't of missed much.
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yeah?
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
Sailor!
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
That don't smell like a More.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
You got me, peanut.
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
You ready for this?
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
You upset with me?
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
One bad car accident...
You sick?
Yeah?
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
I mean tomorrow.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Have it your way... But you want it.
What do you want me to do about it?
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
What?
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
You really are one dumb asshole.
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
So I hear.
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
She's still a transvestite.
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
He said something about being between things.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
Not Curtis.
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
Tripp.
Tripp?!
You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
Naturally you have copies.
That was MacCaulay.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
You must be mistaken.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
The last month maybe.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
With Emily?
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
Kinship.
Maybe she didn't come here.
So, why did you take me up there?
It's warm.
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
I never said that.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
What would you call them then?
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
Where you going?
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
Yes, James.
Hey.
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
You go first.
Not have it.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
Tony. Now that I'm home.
He's writing his name in water.
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
Walter?
I... I...
No.
Do you get high, Sam?
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
I might have his number on campus.
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
You want to keep him happy.
Annette? She's good... tense.
I'm working on it.
Cherry.
Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs?
No thanks.
I'm not a monster.
Carlos, can I ask you something?
Ask me. Ask me anything.
Is that right?
That was terrific.
Were you watching me?
Don't you have friends?
Too much sun.
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
The one with the ax?
Little Red Riding Hood.
I could take you downtown.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
Yes.
I can't.
I said the job is okay.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
It was just an idea.
No fucking way.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
Have to talk about something.
What are you afraid will happen?
What did you think would happen?
Is this the first one?
Go home, Walter.
Not so fast.
All right.
Time.
Want a ride?
What picture?
I'm talking about you.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
Is that a school?
What about them?
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
What?
So... what's your dark secret?
Molested little girls?
You're not joking.
Get your kicks somewhere else.
What was prison like?
You know, this is crazy.
It's a bad idea.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
Do you want to talk about it?
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
I'm switching off now.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
Fine.  Be that way.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
I think it likes you.
He's jammed the mechanism.
What's the plan?
It is insane.
Oh God, Lins... I--
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
Did you find Wilhite?
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
SHIT!
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
How deep?
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
What is that one over there called?
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
Yes, you should go.
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
Claudia, let's get married?
What! Get married?
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
Please, you come too...
And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear?
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
What do you think?
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
And who is this?
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
And where do you find the models?
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
We have a radio like this, too.
No, not like this one.
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
Is that far from here?
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
Yes.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
Because...
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Who tells you these things?
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
Why?
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
It's not my time of month.
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
Yes.
Oh, there are so many.
Where do you meet?
I fell asleep.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
I've stopped menstruating
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
Where do you think babies come from?
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
Why not?
Because I don't want one.
Not my fault.
Answer me!  You never answer me.
I can't.
How?
And that you're stupid?
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Because I'm in trouble.
Of telling you.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
Did you know what was going to come out?
I can't tell you that.
She made me promise not to.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
What do you do?
Yes.
No...
Yes.
H... how?
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
Larry...
I don't know.
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
I can get you new evidence next week.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
Do you still go to church?
Yes... I...
I can beat that.
Was there a priest?
What's your opinion?
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
What?
It's my affair too.
What?
All right, what do you need.
Oh, Dear God...
You lied to me
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
Oh God, if only I'd known.
We'll see about that.
An unhappy woman...
Bullshit!
And what has that to do with it?
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Long, thin and filtered.
Hand rolled.
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Do you want to become one?
Listen to her singing.
I'd like to begin.
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
That's what I have to believe...
She can't remember.
The usual ten per cent?
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
What about all these letters?
Shurrup!
Yeah.
The police station.
Are you going in?
Me? Why?
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
Did you look in here?
Ringo!
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
Well ... come on.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Are you pulling my leg?
Something like that.
Thank you.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
Yes.
See you.
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
Where are you off to?
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
Hiding.
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
What's he know?
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Y'what?
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
I'm not, no.
I would have said so.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
Stop picking on him.
Do I have to raise me voice?
Paul's grandfather.
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
But John hasn't got any.
How's that?
Are you in pain?
I don't recognize that constellation.
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
Well, get started.
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Okay.
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
Dead.
Oh -- God -- oh --
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
What?
Right. 
You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
Oh my God.
Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
Should we go outside and bring him in?
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
What do you mean, no?
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
Oh no.
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
This should do it.
<u>What is it</u>?
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
That tube must be depositing it in him.
We do know that.
Yeah?
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
We won't need it then.
Food-storage room!
Now what?
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
Can we get to him?
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
Picking up velocity.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
Oh, man...
Alright, okay.  Look...
What?  Where?
It's alright, it's cool...
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
That's what we thought.
Compensate!
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
Seltzer?
How's it going?
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
'Bout five minutes.
Phoebe.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
Just like that.
What a day - what a heavenly day...
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
Why'd call me a killer?
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
What do you mean by that?
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
It's the same thing, isn't it?
That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.
I was there. An eyewitness.
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Frankly, I don't remember.
Just slipped your mind.
Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
In time she'll be what you are.
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
I told her. I sounded off.
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
You in a hurry?
Happy birthday, darling...
Many happy returns of the day...
I get a party, don't I?
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
Yeah... I will.
I love you...
I'll check with Eve...
Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
For instance what?
Gone.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
Margo, let's make peace.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...
"Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve."
Yes, dear.
It's only one picture deal.
Also Addison deWitt.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
Who are you?
Miss Harrington...
What for?
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
Oh, no. I see the play.
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
Try...
You're not going, are you?
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
No, don't go...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
Right here.
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
Hello, Miss Channing.
Harrington.
How much time have we?
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Why should he - and why should you?
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Now just a minute-
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
How do you mean?
She's your understudy.
To you, too?
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
Hello..
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
All you got to do is name it.
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
Answer my question!
Let me lay a little theory on you--
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
I hate both parties.
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
--shit, who do we know?--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
How high up, which Republicans?
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
The telephone calls... we know about that.
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
I think.
There's always a later plane.
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
You've really got to go.
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
I don't know titles.
--I'm sure--
--I'm not here.
Look, I told you inside--
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
I have nothing more to say.
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
Haldeman too?
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
--yes, yes, what is it?
I think so.
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
Lotsa hints--
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
Whaddya got, whaddya got?
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
Anyone but Bernstein.
--remember Toronto, Harry.
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
This.  Right now.
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
Nice car.
You don't like it?
What?  No I'm not.
I wasn't making fun of you.
You talked to Stifler?
So you're going to Michigan?
Onions?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
Yeah right.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
But that one time --
Are you kidding?  No.
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
Pontificated.
You can send me the address too.
Did I miss anything?!
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
What's up, fellas?
Shame on you!
Uh...
Move with the music.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
Vicky, wait.
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
Now?!
Me too.
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
Also like sex with my wife.
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
They're coming!
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
Didn't even have to ask.
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Well, they are French.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Ha. Some wonder drug...
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
Psychic awareness. Right.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
Uncle Terrence?
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Not that I know.
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
We're just going to refresh your memory...
Did I tell you that?
You never thought of the possibility?
Come on!
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
Every Russian family has one..
Do you remember this?
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
He's her?
The "Odessa Dunk"?
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
It's an important issue.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Why not?
It's okay.
Yeah? Allison what?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Oh!
Alvy, I...
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
Well, then, w-who was?
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
Oh, you see an analyst?
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, sorry.
Uh, narcolepsy.
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
I know.
Hey?
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
Those are the two categories...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
Do I love you?
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
I have a tiny apartment.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
What are you doing?
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
Following is different. I was spying.
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
There's a spider in the bathroom.
Is he in the bathroom?
snow shovel or anything or something.
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
Okay, okay. Okay.
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
Check it out.
Remember, we had that thing.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
Oh-
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
What'd I do?
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
Here you are. There's people out there.
I can't.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
I mean that as a compliment.
Probably on their first date, right?
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Just give me the license, please.
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
Ah.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
How about a ginger ale?
You like this house, Max?
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
You fired the cleaning woman?
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
Oh.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Hey-
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Did you know the contractor?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
Had a little help?
It has your ring.
It's going.  It's going.
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
She already has.
Just don't fucking tell her.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
Thanks for coming.
Anymore.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Can I open it?
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
What is it?
But she's alright.
Oh.  You're them.
Are you my big hard hero?
Hm.  We should do it again.
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
Probably not.
We closed.
I adore him.
Accept a compliment.
Through the sweats or not?
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
I'm going to throw up.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
It's a novel.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
This is insanity.  Sally...
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Don't do this.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
You changed your mind.
No.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
Happy anniversary.
Will you make love with me?
Oh, you know, I am.
What's a sign for that?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
And I you.
Ah.
You lose this?
You got your DP?
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
What?
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
Are you okay?
I've never done this before.
Ryan's really angry with me.
That's very nice.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
Jesus Christ.
Yes.
Ryan!
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
If he were still alive, maybe.
We're just feeling our way back.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
Um.  Happy for you.
Thanks.
You're my best friend.
We're going to have to go back out there.
You're keeping a record, are you?
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
Yes.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
Invisible!
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
Well I guess that makes us even.
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Worker!  Come back here now!
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
Who is that idiot?
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
No -- you -- you don't understand!
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
So...you two are in love?
What do you see out there?
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
I can't think of any.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
That makes me feel just terrible.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
Good night.
Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
Oh.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
I forgive you.
Three.
No -- I like it.
I don't understand --
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
And where are you now?
What's her first name?
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
I am. Let me get the cards.
Give what up?
A cemetery?
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
There's a call for you --
What are you doing with that?
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
We're going to finish that gin game.
Oh.
Fine. How's your eye?
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
I never thought he'd do it.
Oh.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
That's right, Baxter.
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
So it was.  She threw it at me.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
Don't mind what?
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
How's that again?
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
You can't come in.
Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Me?
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
Aren't you?
How's the patient?
Sure, Doc.
That so.
No kidding.
Good night.
The party's over.
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Yes, I know.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
We talked about a lot of things.
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
You're not being funny.
Handle what?
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Yeah, we better.
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
What are you talking about?
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
Where do you live?
I told you -- with my mother.
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
We need all our fuel anyway.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
One for all -- all for one --
No.
Fat. That's real fat.
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
How long were you up there ?
A long time.
Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.
Who's he?
Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
Yeah, I know.
Can I go get those mangos now?
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning.
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
I --
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
Anybody see some smoke ?
They nail him for it bad ?
Would he remember you ?
Ours.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
Who is he?
We don't want to bother you any, we --
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is.
What?
Haiphong.
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
Music?
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
What Truth?
What are you doing?
You had immense plans... immense plans...
Both of us...
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
What's that?
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
So Kurtz is alive.
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
I should be checking on the boat.
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
I know.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
My dad was a Navy doctor.
What happened here?
Somewhere along the pipeline.
What are you doing?
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
Where's Corbett?
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
New to the country, kid?
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
Stay put!
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
Don't bet on it.
Shut up!
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
If Corbett's men find out --
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
There's what they're waiting on!
I'm sorry.
Don't be silly. How bad?
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
It's amazing these things weren't done.
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
How old are you?
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
Carol the waitress?
Why did yo do this for me?
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
I can't. I work.
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Hi.
Thanks, Melvin.
Hello.
Okay to say something now?
Were you asleep?
I wasn't asleep!!
Because...
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
But what about...
I love you...  Let him take you home.
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
How's Verdell doing?
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
Actually, I don't think so.
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Do you realize that I work at him?
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
What are you talking about? You got real problems.
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
I told you to go on in.
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
Did you like it that much?
What's it mean?
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
What?
Uh, Fontella's
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
How long have you been freelance?
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
How did he know?
Who is the mark?
The contract?
I know what happened.
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
Yeah.
Okay.  How did you find me?
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
With computers.
He was... taken.
But you knew what they were training you for?
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Why?
No.  Just the first one.
No.
Do you think about the game?
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
Where did you learn it?
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
That's right.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
What did he say?
Was that it?
No.
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
Yes.
Attraction is a complication?
It happened to you before?
Yes.
What happened to her?
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Martin.
Four minutes.
I'm taking off my mike.
You're very good at this aren't you?
It's possible.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
That's correct.
What are you having?
A coke, if they have it?
Cheers Katka!
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
How to make a buck!
An alternative literary venue!
Like Custer huh?
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
I thought that was part of the charm!
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Perfect!
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
No, not yet.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
No, the boyfriend.
She's cool.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
Tell me some bad news?
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
What happened?
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Yeah, Dave Walters.
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
What about me?
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
That's my mum's.
I've been around.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
So, we won't be going to London?
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
I thought for sure they would catch me.
Forget about me Kat.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
About forty minutes.
Okay?
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
How do I know what's being said?
We don't need you.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
We_re not all running away
Shall I wash these out?
No, just a coffee.
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Hmm, I still owe him.
Why don't we both forget about him?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
And the students?
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
Hey Doug, where you been?
Yeah.
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
I think we should be going honey.
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
Why are there still such headlines?
You are responsible...What has happened?
All the more reason to eliminate him.
He wants to show now.
You look nice. I should have dressed.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
Landon!
Because, growing up, books were my world.
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
-- Your act only works with an audience.
I'll take a chance.
It's private.
I'll get something for us to drink --
Because I try to be nice to people?
Saturn. Beautiful.
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
You're really into God, right?
You have to believe to have faith.
Oh. Just not at school...
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
You're acting like a crazy person.
We can measure wind.
Are you trying to seduce me?
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
Why didn't you tell me?
But if you could, you would?
No. I want what's best for you.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
Your parents are divorced?
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
I'd do that --
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
Learn anything?
Dad, you seen the drill?
'Bike fine point?'
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
So what? We'd be rich!
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
An atomic bomb.
Professor, be serious, would you?
Where did you get this?
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
My guess is that she turned him down.
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
Hi. where's Cato?
He said not to tell.
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
Don't you ever get bored around here?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
I mean it.
What'd you come out here for?
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
It's okay.
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Yeah.
Well, stop the world.
Is he upset?
Positive?
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
It was going too fast.
What's that?
Hold it right there.
You tossed my hat out the window.
New Jersey?
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
Dead.  Damnit!
Got a casualty list?
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
He offered you money?
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
You don't wanna know.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
No, sir.  I think the flint...
What's happening with my call to SAC?
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
Let him go.
Hello.
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity – the basest coin there is.
Well that's what he said.
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the –
I didn't say anything-
To do what?
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
...That's fine.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if – well I know I sometimes run on.
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
Hold on –
What do you think happened?
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
Mr. Lipnik, I –
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
How is your -- personal life?
It's been three months.
How's not smoking?
Catherine Tramell.
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
What did she tell me, Beth?
How long were you having sex with him?
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
But you didn't hurt --
No.
Sure.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
I like you.
Don't get too cocky.
Fine.
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
What did you think?
How's your shoulder?
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
Yes I am.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Nilsen?
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
I don't know.
You look like dogshit.
Homicide.
What do you want?
You sure?
She's a suspect.
Why do you think he's dead?
No. Should I have?
When's your show?
Why, so you could humiliate me?
It's in New York.
Who is it?
Annina Nosei.
How much for these five?
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Who did this?  Who did this?
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
MOTHAFUCKAH!
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
... Can you... decipher this for us?
They're just words.
Yes, I understand – but where do you take them from?
Yes, but as a black painter –
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called – hmmm...  – yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Paint it out.
You want me to put it here?
SAMO.
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
Check you later, man.
You gonna carry that around all night?
What's the rush, John Henry?
I don't really have any problems.
She's good.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
What who's saying?
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Me? Why?
You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother – when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
I'm listed.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
"We"?  You and...
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
... What do we do?
No.  No glass on the inside.
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
Wonder if it's worth my time.
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
And a very, very good one.
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
What seems to be the problem?
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
You'd be surprised.
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
What are you talking about?
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
Umm-hmmmm.
No beauty...
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
No!?
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
But he's never said a word-
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
You will rescue my wife
I find that unlikely.
I've got to stop him.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
The dreams again, sir?
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
There's one other thing. I feel..
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Letters in the alphabet.
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
Just checking, young sir.
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
We all wear masks.
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
So glad you could come.
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
Find anything interesting?
Why do you do that?
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
Absolutely not.
You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
...You gonna kill me?
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
No.  Wait...
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
A-14.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
Thank you, Vicki.
... How long have I been out?
Is this what you wanted?
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
As far as I know.
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
Got it!
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
Peanuts?
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Are they paying you for all this?
Not what?
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ....
Scottish.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Everything's gonna be fine.
What happened?!!!
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
And howls Alison?
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
No!
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.  All Englishmen are ugly.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
What?
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Ow! These chips suck.
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
Well where is she?!
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Uh... bye-bye.
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Ah, the witness?
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
You'll be rich!
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
Won't?  Or can't?
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
Oh, honey, we may need that.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
What about this Beetle guy?
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
Here's something.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
And your sushi was remarkable.
Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
What is going on?
Did you get the paint?
Help vouchers?
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
All right.  Who are you?
We're very unhappy.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
What about Betelgeuse?
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
And live in what, our station wagon?
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
Yeah.
I don't know what that signal means.
Beetle!
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
... I will.
W... What is it?
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
They're... not here anymore.
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
Are they suffering?
All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
What's wrong?
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
Yes. I think so, too.
You can pull your trousers up, now.
... Straight out?
Thank you.
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
It's fine today, Robert.
... Oh? You've heard?
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
Do you know Raphael?
There's no need for a hospital.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
No. It won't do that.
Fine. He's very nice.
Hello, Eve.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
Do you like it?
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
Certainly, Ben.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
A flower...
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
Does it have a television?
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
Yes. That is surprising.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
Have you served in the Army?
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
But you won't sign, correct?
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
Good evening, Wilson.
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
... How are the kids getting along?
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
No! He's a real gardener!
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
This is not what I requested.
Good. Anything else?
The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
I never played a jewel thief.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Is the trial date set?
Hmmm.
Hi.
I was worried.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
What?
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
And he was with her.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
Let me try.
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Yex?
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
Is that true?
No, really.
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
What'll you have?
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
A scary dream?
What kind of circumstances?
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Forget it.
Fork ah did?
Yes, my dear?
Thank you, Floris.
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
Anybody else?
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
She's not available.
Never heard of it.
How'd you get this number?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
You still there, sweets?
No one would ever have to know its not him.
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
That's the last thing they took from me.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
Not like He punished me.
What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
Yes ma'am.
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Morning.
Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..I don't care..ain't laying that down..no sir. I refuse..that's right..that's right...
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
Just me.
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
You don't know what I think.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
What? What? You talking back to me?
Make it the way I always do.
Yeah?
Fuck.
Shit.
Where'd she been?
I know my rights.
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
The?  Who the fff--
Yeah.
That is for the urn.
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
Burkhalter.
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
I'm not really, uh.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Different mothers, huh?
I like your style, Dude.
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Yeah man.
Is that what that's a picture of?
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
From who?
Dieter Hauff?
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
The fucking point is--
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
Easy, Dude.
What the fuck?
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Is this your homework, Larry?
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
Huh?
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Who is this?
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
Dude here.
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Dude.
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
Impressive.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
how long since he was bitten?
Recognize him?
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
How does it look?
I don't like it.
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
So?
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Tell me something, Skid --
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Maybe I don't see it that way.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
Is something wrong, my friend?
You're blind --
Why?
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
How did you know?
But, he could've --
What are you doing?!
There are worse things than vampires out there.
What am I injecting you with?
You care about him, don't you?
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
I'm not leaving without you.
-- tearing me -- apart.
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
That's weird --
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
Bullshit! Talk!
Trying to find the energy.
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
'Thought those all got stolen.
--<u>myth</u>--
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
Anna--
For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a <u>chance</u>?
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
What can I get you?
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
I want to see something!
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
What? That made her lose the baby?
What?
What're you, crazy??
Too busy eating us?
Where <u>is</u> it?
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
What the fuck--??
--I saw what I saw.
For "James?"
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
--Graduate Thesis--
What're you doing?
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
He'll never know.
Are you alright?
Get some more beer.
She's off her fucking rocker--
--a <u>lot</u>.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Anna--
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
What happened to my Dad??
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
See a guy.
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
...So?
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
...What was that back there?
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
What do you think?
...There's a big--
Yeah. Is it...
Ya catch any fish?
...What kind of fish?
Has Ray come in yet?
Red Label.
Right. Sorry.
Deuce in the corner needs help.
What's the point?
What day is it today, Angie?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
You did? A human ear?
Why do you do it?
What is this? What color is it?
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
You want to see him too, right?
I wanted to see you.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Thank you. honey.
Frank? .can you stand up?
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
What do you want?
Dorothy. no!
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Oh yeah?
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Am I bothering you?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
You like mysteries that much?
... You look beautiful.
You want to dance?
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
... Sandy?.
How ya doin' Dad?
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
What?
God. you scared me.
No. you're right.
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
On the plane.
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
Five-thousand per kilo.
Nothing like this back home.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
And I only deal with you?
For calling you a homo.
What's that?
If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
Your offense?  Why are you here?
Nothing.  Just a little project.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
We're half a million off.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
Today.
Surprised to see me?
Who's the cheapskate?
Actually, it was three.
It's beautiful.
And Diego?
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
What are you going to do?
Not mad.
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
Dad.
Give this to Mom, will you?
Figured it out.
George.
Figured it out.
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
What are you doing here?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
Who's the co-pilot?
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
So?
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
And you believe the NLF?
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
Sail.
Third group.
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thèbes?
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
Why?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
Then how did it get into his body?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Yes.
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?
I had some papers to pick up.
No -- but I can get it for you.
She was here?
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
Why did she say she was leaving?
Why do you think she left you?
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
Who was your primary beneficiary?
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
What did she say?
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
Then what happened?
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
Yes.
I've tried it.
Yes.
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
--and that he changed his will?
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Yes.
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
Frank!
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
That's not an answer.
Yes -- it would be nice.
You were brilliant today.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
You don't need anybody.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
What are they saying?
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
If he files are you going to take the case?
Why don't you talk to him now?
What's wrong?
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
No.
My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
I never knew that.
She's changed.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
They got heat in Michigan.
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
You want me to call the doctor?
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
After the divorce.
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Oh, that's nice.
Francesca.
And clean.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
You want to eat something?
Yes.
Have you ever been to that station?
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Am I too heavy for you?
Yes, thanks.
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
What are you doing?
Stop it!
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.
Then he can move! People move!
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
I'm going to miss you.
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
Are you nuts?
'S up?
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
You think that's really him?
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
That's some terrible shit.
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
What else?  Money.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
Those 'fools' are my people.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
Lucky thing.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
Bill!  Bill?!
Patrick, he's...
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
You were just a kid.
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
Nice rack.  How old is --
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
You gotta use your imagination.
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
You shouldn't have hit me.
What's that, Johnnie?
We're family, Caesar.
No!
Gimme the gun.
So, you just got out?
What?
It couldn't have been.
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
No.
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Shut up, Violet.
You betrayed me!
Yes, I understand.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
What?  How about a drink?
Another time.
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
You got the key?
I guessed you were straight black.
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
Do you know him?
Thanks.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
What do you want?
How did you meet him?
How long have you been with him?
What?
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
The redistribution of wealth?
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
I'm not afraid of anything.
We're not that different, Corky.
Because it's the truth.
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
That's his brother.
Any bodyguards?
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
He'll have to run.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
I had a partner and she fucked me.
I'm still here.
No.
Johnnie, what did I say?
I know you will.
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
And what if I couldn't do that?
-- if we can get a clean shot --
We don't know what we're into!
I won't ask again.
Jason Bourne is dead.
You have your passport?
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
Really.
Oh, Jesus... 
It's a little late for that.
I've got a situation here and --
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
Listen to what you want.
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
That's what I'm saying.
No.
What are you talking about?
I can't believe I slept.
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
No.
I trusted you.
-- we'll explain it --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
Nykwana Wombosi. 
xxxxxx

You have ID?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
xxxxxx...
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
Sir...
What the fuck is he doing?
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
Where am I?
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
It's reply paid.
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Jack!
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
Am I?
You killed him?
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Say it was a mistake.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
You stupid bastard!
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
How do you think I feel? You shit!
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Who are you? Let go!
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
Them?
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Who is this war against, Sam?
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Oh God! What have we done?
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Leave me alone!
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
Yes.
What do you think? ... is it me?
Don't worry.
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
He is dead.
Try next of kin.
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
You are good to me Sam.
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
Damn! Blast!
My mother said it would be all right.
How long will she he away?
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
Hello. Mr Lowry?
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
Ha!!
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
The pace?
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
No, no, that's impossible.
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
He looks like a cop.
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
You're going to live.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
No.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
Sure, sure, give go.
Is he going to be alright?
The first is always the best.
At least he's got people around him.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
I think this place stinks.
Did you see my father?
No.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
I think it looks good.
He's better.
Five years.
Maybe I should come up with you.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
I'll drink to that.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
The family know?
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Frank!
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
Oh no!--I just remembered.
Well why didn't you say so?
Faster! God!
Stomach again.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
How <u>you</u> doing?
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
You're feeling good, aren't you?
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
London.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
That's your full name?
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
Okay.  Let's do me.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Of course.
We can cut back at the end.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
As good as humanly possible.
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
How'd it go?
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
Let's go...
I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
Stop it.
How long has it been since you've been home.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
Yes.  That's right.
I really have to go.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
What?
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Bye, sweetie.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
It's not opinion.
If we could just eat first.
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
Hi.
What do you mean clean?
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
You okay?
You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
I'll wait for you till seven.
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
What?
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
Hi.  It's me.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
Where's the bathroom?
Uh-huh.
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Oh it's enough...
Anything new?
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
You really like it?
Look at the size of it!
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
May I please have another little kiss?
Are you ready?
I like you very much, Walter.
Forget it.
Nothing...nothing at all.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
Man look at that get up !
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Where'd ya buy that?
You...made that?
Yeah.
Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  How's that?
A show..how soon can we go?
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
No...look I'm busy...
Police officer.
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
Walter shut up and relax!
After that we go no more!
What do you get?
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
Don't grab me, okay?
It's coffee.
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
I'm hungry.
Hi, Buffy.
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
I do?  I guess I do.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
You weren't home.  Like always.
You're even weaker than the others.
Hi there.
Is that your car?
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
Things are kind of confusing.
I know.
He did what he was supposed to.
) What do you think?
You were supposed to be here at three.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
Meet me at this address after school.
I have cheerleading squad.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Here?
Put your head back.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
They were vampires?
Same one.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
You are such a wet.
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
Watchers?
Vampires of the world, beware.
Interesting.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
I don't get it.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
I don't understand.
Bessel!  What are you doing here?
Oh, baby!
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
Okay, let's go.
I can't believe they still ate it.
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
Oh, yeah!
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
The right nostril.  Good.
My right nostril?
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
Death is like spring training?
Nuke?!
Yes I do...
What a nasty thing to say.
What'd he say?
We lost.
--but you're father's in there!
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
You got me all confused.
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
I doubt that.
It's possible.
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
I got him on the knee!
Beg me again!
You're a cocksucker!
Why am I a fuck?
No.
Forget it.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
Step outside, pal.
I gotta go now, Dad.
Ain't he warning up?
Struck out eighteen...
Eight and twenty-four.
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
You were wandering around.
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
Excuse me.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
702 472 1862.
I'll call you right back.
Now this is just a signature card.
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
Okay.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
Just say so.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
...don't do it to me...
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
I see you, you motherfuckers.
...hundred yards further down the road.
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
You never - ?
Yeah.
Sammy.
Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
Well, sir, I was just...
I...
Nice to see you, Senator.
Now, he's really pissed.
Any change?
She took care of the dealers...
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
I - I - I...
Want to go? Let's go back in.
It's chinchilla.
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
Okay.
Pretty serious.
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
Should I let her in like - ?
...Well, I've got a large family.
How many kids do you have?
Loose machines are right back over there.
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
So, you're a righty?
Excuse me.
What?
I just wanna get out of here.
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
...I got muscled on the street.
Mm.
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Yes.
Hi. Good.
Go get a bag, man.
You just - Just stop him.
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Yeah?
Now move along.
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
Is that what you did?
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
For what?
What're you gonna do?
No. I ain't see anything like that.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Mm.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Tell me.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
Hm.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
Get lost?
Well, how 'bout that?
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Okay, then.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Here.
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
Listen...
Why?
Ace saw Vegas one way.
It's up to you.
They'll do it.
Yeah.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Get out. Get out! Get out!
Frankie!
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
Works for me.
Guilty. I am.
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
Are you sure?
Women, huh?
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
God-damn..
You like them, don't you, Boss.
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
I loved you.
I'm a good mother!
What's the name of your child's best friend?
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
Maybe.
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
Make a "U" and go back.
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Do I know you?
I don't want to know --
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Don't lay this on me!
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
"Theo?"
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
Sometimes I paint.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
She's gone --
Not a chance.
Do you know what's in that box?
They'll recognize it's not your husband.
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
Can you walk?
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
It's locked.
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
You could've hit me.
Did you hear that?
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
I'm handling it.
Took preparation.
Five ... six.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
There are no guarantees in this life.
Pass.
What time frame have you got in mind?
I don't know what you mean.
You should've done all this before.
What's he doing?  Answer me!
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
Yeah?
What does it take to kill you?
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Seems not.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Why are you picking on me for?
There's no lady here.
I thought so.
Good thing in a man.
Don't be like that --
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
No, of course not, she's a lady.
What's it to you?
What's that about?
What'll it be?
Tell me about him.
You want to know how I kissed him?
Are you jealous of him?
I think you do.
You mean that?
Can't leave me now.
What you thinking of, hon?
No...
That's a start.
How?
I should have known, shouldn't I?
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
No. Can't pretend that much.
Why, honey --
You gonna tell me why?
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
It's her, isn't it?
What's her?
She from Scotland too?
You could say that.
Anything.
No.
Prescription. For my condition.
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here
I like you, Dil --
She was --
Yes.
You've got to go now, Dil --
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
Lucky you.
What was it?
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
Do you now.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Did you give him it?
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
But, then, I don't have a choice.
Och, you do, Fergie.
You may be right.
Jude?
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Why?
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
So it was you all the time.
Who'd you think it was?
I understand.
Aye, I do, Peter.
A hotel?
Thank God for that.
How is it a farce?
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
What's that?
No?
And you play cricket?.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Now, that was worth waiting for.
See? I was right about you.
Doesn't matter where.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
Who's Dil?
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
I could eat a horse.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
That's right.
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
Adam!
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
Lord, you're stubborn.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
Yes, you told me.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
But --
Oh.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
Carson?
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Café.
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
Steal it how?
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
No.
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
What's your first name today?
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
But you're -- divorced?
Me?
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
Carson Dyle is dead.
Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
Why can't you be serious?
There, you said it.
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
What's so illogical about that?
Alex --
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
What do you want?
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
Is it all right?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
I found it! I found it!
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Quitter.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
We'll find you a hotel.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
Of course? I thought he was dead.
You mean you and me?
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
What your husband was mixed up in.
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
Do you know what's wrong with you?
Nothing. Good night.
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
I believe what he said.
Words can hurt very much.
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
Yeah? What's that?
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
You know her?
No I wasn't.
We need you here. I can bring her in.
Should we close down any eruption?
Well?
Did you warn her?
What are you doing?
You know where I can find her?
Of what?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
Can you describe her? How old was she?
No.
Really?
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
Really?
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
You're the killed.
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
You eventually have to talk to him.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
Especially not your dad.
I won't.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Twenty eight years ago.
Cut it out.
Why?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
I'll think about it.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
Are you coming to the party?
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
Mom?
I need to ask you something.
Yeah. Who is she?
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
What?
Where are you going?
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
His mother's side.
What?
Did you want one?
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
You can have both if you want.
Now don't be nervous.
No.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
Okay, okay.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Since today.  New policy.

Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
...-tana.
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
I need your truck!
You'd better coast through...
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
That's...
 
Okay, okay! 



 Nice job back there.
 No...
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
 
...truck!
...easy, easy, easy.
Come on.
...Night Shift, but you might...
 I made it.
Shut up!
Hey!
Come on.
 Okay.  Okay. 
I'm a dangerous man!

Worth a try.
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
So you took his...
We were nationally  ranked.
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
Robert Del Rio?
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
We got two paddles.
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
That is loud!  I'm 
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
...man.
Put your hand in my pants.

...-natic.
Sometimes the prey bites back.
Stop.
Hang...
Forty-five seven!
And Brynner's right on...
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
Stupid.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
 What's it say? 
All right 
Oh.



We're the shit.  Bigtime.
You.
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
Thank you.
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
Hey, be cool.
This country trained me to kill...
...without compunction.

But...

...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...


And I changed the schedule.
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
Is this stool taken?
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
Mm-hm.
Closin' down, sir.


This was supposed to be a...
Get your links set up!
...here!
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
Mornin'.
I assume you have one.
Hello.
...the river.
Your fellow hero, untouched...

No.
I can handle it.
Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--?
Forty-nine?
It must've happened right after we left.
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
...-five.


...is a perfect hunter.
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...back...
The compound has to be kept cold...
...-m-means, Mason.  
Yeah, I just....
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
 ...miles. 
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
...seriously.
...beer.
Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
...side!
What happened to Colonel Brynner?



Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
Sir?
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
Do you know him?
None.
Yeah.
No.
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
She's fine.
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
Hello.
Either that or she'll be in jail.
What are you talking about?
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
Curly, where's your car?
Where's that?
Could you drive me somewhere?
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
Well you own a lot of land.
Looking for someone.
No?
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
Iced tea.
What do you mean?
Unless what?
Did you have affairs?
I can't tell you.
You mean you don't know where you were?
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
What dam?
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Is that unusual?
Working for the District Attorney.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
Hold still. Why?
Just... I have to.
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
Yes.
Aren't you coming back with me?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Upstairs. Why?
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
How about a plane?
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Oh no.
I'm sorry. We don't.
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
He never even kids about it.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
I cut myself shaving.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
Yes...
Mr. Gittes?
Do you know me?
Si.
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
The L.A. River?
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
She ran away?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
What are you doing here?
Fifty lire... 
Alfredo, did you know my father?
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
No...
Why? What do you mean?
Yes. 
Now what can you see?
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
Thanks for all you've done for me.
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
How long's it been shut?
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..." 
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
You don't really think so?
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
What's happened?
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Hello, Mr. Leland.
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
Are they standing for me?
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
There is no news big enough.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
Emily!
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
Where's the towel?
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Half past eleven.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
You goin', Mom?
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
Do you know what that is?
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
Good.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
Charlie -
What do you mean by that?
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
All right.
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
Yes.
Hello, Brad.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Rawlston is my boss.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
Well, if it's already too late...
It's not the same.
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
That's it, everybody out.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
Can I use the bathroom?
Nobody! I swear!
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
So what are you saying?
Who doesn't?
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
Cute cat. What's his name.
What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
You're late.
You don't want to know.
Did you tell Veronica?
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Eight and a half?
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
That's frightening.
I'm talking to myself here.
Return of the Jedi.
And you figured it out?
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
There aren't.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
You know what pisses me off the most?
At least we're stuck here together.
Design major.
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
I'm going with you.
You were saying?
An embarrassing way to die.
No!
Who found him?
Balls resting on his lips.
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
Her fucking body fell out!
Fine. Just lend me your car.
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
I like to expand my horizons.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
Holy shit. That girl?
Now I know you're lying.
I'm not. She just left.
Hey, what about Veronica?
Who eats cock?
What are you talking about?
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
As if it's that easy.
Leave her out of this.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
You still didn't have to choke me.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
She's my girlfriend.
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
You calling me a liar?
So I'm told.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
Yeah, but...
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
You sucked his dick!
Dante...
Um. Thirty-seven.
A few?
What is it?
Really?  You're the best.
You had to tell him.
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
He only speaks Russian?
What did he say?
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
To an Asian design major.
I beg your pardon!
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
You're not?
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!
I copy.
Where are you, Walker?
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
There wasn't time for anything else.
Two...
And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever.
I know...
Did I miss something?
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
Let's be creative.
What about you?
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
Gabe!  Are you alright?
Thanks for holding on.
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
Just kidding.
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
Murdering, motherfucker...
Travers, you're not running things.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
Yeah...
What's your names?
Got to be Comb Bluff.
You're looking at him.
Where's the rest of the team?
Don't use my name!
Don't give him anything.
What about it?
This way.
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
No names, this is an open line!
Richard Travers.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
Been punished, yeah?
Good evening, sir.
No. She's dead!
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
Hullo.
You've not been to school all week, son.
Just a manner of speech, sir.
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
Do you feel that way now?
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
Helping you, sir?
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her.
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
Fine... fine.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
But it was horrible.
How are you feeling today?
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Just part of hospital routine.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
You're keen on music?
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
Don't read it - sign it!
Hullo, son, how are you?
Most of the time.
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
Jesus...
What kind of question?
What?
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
It's nothing.
Yo, whassup?
You hassling my driver again?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
I think he's dead.
You - you killed him?
No.  You say you're cool.
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
58th and Central.  You know it?
How can you kill him like that?
How?
I'm...what?  Sorry?
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
No.
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
What happened?
It's not bullshit.
Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
How long have you been a hit man?
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
No, not just that.
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
The guy came right at us!
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
Motive?
You think I'm crazy.
I think you're different.
You bit someone's nose off?
What's the charge?
Just relax.
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
Arf... You gotta help me.
What took so long?  You were in there all day.
See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
Please put it down.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Did you kill my father?!
Love at first sight?
How'd you get the picture?
Liza?
Geronimo is down.
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
I'm leaning toward no.
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
We're very specialized.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
Working.
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
Is it possible...?
Pepsi?  Tequila?
Meaning...
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
So we passed some kind of test?
So.  What happens now?
It's time to go home now.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
Not if you think like a Vegan.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
And?
The V.L.A.?
Ellie -- are you okay?
I'm -- I'm fine.
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
Spoken like a true believer.
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
Yes.  Very much.
So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
Some of my best friends are scientists.
Ellie, what is it?
I'm sorry -- I can't --
What?
-- I don't know --
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
You don't take another man's place, boy.
Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
No.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Gotta go, Arletta.
Gotta have kings.
Then how come it ain't done yet?
What's all this dirt in the yard?
Please! Please!
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'!  You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
Where'd the road go?
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
Oh Lord!
Man Oh Man.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
One, two, three... 
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
Now look what you did.
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
Yes.  Without question.
What pattern was that?
The first two murders.
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Who was the man in the basement?
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Is he out?
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
For months... last October.
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
How do you know that?
I'm going to put a guard on your door.
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
Then what do you need me for?
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
Why should I trust you?
What's that siren?
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
They all have one...
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Who came in after you?
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Snotty neurotic bitch...
You came in there with this attitude...
What's wrong with him?
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
Yessir.
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
Where you going?
M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
Or the F.B.I.?
Give me Ruben back...
Outside in the visitors, car park.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
What kind of place is this?
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
Then, you should call.
Maybe.
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Really?
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
Ecru.
What's his name, Letty?
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
Must you walk so quickly?
There's a spider in my room.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
Very romantic setting.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
Your family just met me.
No, I need some serious household advice.
I love the pillows.
It's TV heaven.
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Not yet.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
And all the plans we have.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
Yeah.
You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
Where are the tapes?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
Zero.   That's all I know.
Who?
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
I'm not here to negotiate.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
We still have to get out of here.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
Hadley --
Did you have to use that much explosive?
Okay, we're square now, right?
Hector, don't interrupt me.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
You said don't do it, boss.
They were all French guys.
Everything.
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
What hotel?
I was told to take what we have and go.
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
"Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
You guys used to work together?
It's good.
No.
Mr. Zammito?
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
He speaks about himself in the third person?
J&amp;B?
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
When do we go?
You ever hear of jet lag?
Did she break your heart?
You ask a lot of questions.
What's this?
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
Who are you?
I don't care about your sword.
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
I'm just playing around.
Tell me, who is your master?
I owe you nothing.
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
I'm tired now.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
You're too young to understand.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
About you and Li Mu Bai?
I'll give them to you.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Kneel!
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
Lo?
You shouldn't have come.
You coward!
Jen...
Yes.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
No, not yet...
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
I'll look around and catch up later.
What happened?
A murderer?
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
But the sword could be in his compound.
Talent. Hi.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
They couldn't do anything for me.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
Do you feel okay.
I don't know you.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Get it?
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
I don't think so.
That's right.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Nothing.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
It's not really important.
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
You've read The Fountainhead?
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
I never said that.
Why not?
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
That's none of your business.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
Of Human Bondage.
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
What?
That's not fair.
Hi.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
But you knew this was important to me.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Outstanding.
What are the boys like?
I'm in the bath, mom.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
What are you saying?
I don't know.
Okay.
Well did you like it?
I did?
But -
I like it better when I'm on top.
Good night Cecile.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
Don't you want to change that?
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Who told you?
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
No.
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
Hello.
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
Care to make a wager on that?
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
Fuck her yet?
I'm working on it.
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
No.
Yippy.
Nothing.
With who?
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
Where'd she go?
Kind of.
You didn't?
Oh yes.
Tell me all the details.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
Get off me!
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
I can't thank you enough.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Well please leave a message that I called.
I'll do that.
It's really important.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
But where did you get it, Amy?
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
Irena.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
Something's haywire,
I'm never unfair.
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
I thought you were with Amy.
That's the Farren house.
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
Yes, daddy.
But wishes don't come true.
It's true.
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
Yes, darling.
I don't know yet.
No.
I've wanted a friend.
But where is that?
I can not tell you.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
The numbers simply don't mean anything
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
You?
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
What?
Mother! You called me by name!
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
What?
I mean where on your body?
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
Give him the tampon test.
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
I think he called you beautiful.
Charming Carlton.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
Why the fuck would you do that?
I could smell another woman on him.
Peter knows something.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
What choice do we have?
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
Frida? You okay?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
Where'd you get the bike?
This really isn't a good time.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
Mark.
I'm sorry.
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
Like what?
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
Except Mark of course.
Be careful!
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
No, I have a cat.
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
What kind of animal?
I need something to keep me awake.
What's he doing here?
The other one?
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
What is this place?
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnít this his case?
Sorry, sir.
It seems fine.
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
Who?
They didn't have faces.
What now?
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
But...  How long has this been happening?
I see.  The verdict, yes...
Then we must call the police.
If you like.
Not that again...
What are you hiding?
How do you know I'm innocent?
What?
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Just don't call him, Alan!
A condition...
Fine.
I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
I'm going to kill him.
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
Just what you think I mean.
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
And who's gonna find out?
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
Oh my God...
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
Dave!
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Oh... Thanks.
Your government needs your help.
What?
I can't say.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
... How could I what?
You sure this goes somewhere?
You have a lot of secrets.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
It was okay?
Well I guess...
I know. I'm sorry...
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
It could be fun.
The Monroe?
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
Help me get him to the boat.
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
Sir. It's quite clear that...
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
How long do we have to watch him?
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
God....damn you, Rhodes!
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
I don't know.  I don't get it.
Women swoon!
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
Knox, you gotta calm down.
Yeah.
So?
What is the point?
Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
I here and now commit myself to daring!
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
Sure.
Who's in?
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
Hello?
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
No.
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
Are you going with Chet?
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
A crazy madman.
Come on boys, don't be shy.
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
I'll take him over mine.
A play, dummy.
And now he will?
Todd, what's the matter?
what?
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
Put more into it!
I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
Maybe we lost them.
What other bunch?
Jesus Christ lady...
You don't have to be so touchy.
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
Like cattle...
You want ME to go up there?
So?
Hanover!! Hanover!!
I think he knows that Joey.
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
Joey...
Or maybe not.
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
Check it out!
Fuel up. Need fuel.
You want 'em?
Damn right!
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
John,we're going huntin'.
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
Who's full of shit?
That's new, isn't it?
I got delayed. I --
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
You like to call me Linda now?
Linda, yeah.
Get anything?
Naw.
Yeah?
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Hey, Nick...
No?
Nick, she won't say why.
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
How's the trailer?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
Playing?
This is horrible!
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
Yeah... I guess.
Nick, he just came back.
From Nam?
Hell no!
Huh?
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
What are you, hoping?
What else?
I'm doing that too.
Nick!... I thought you went home.
How's Linda?
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
Here, here! This is it!
Watch it, shithead!
No!!!?
Where's Vince?
See you Monday.
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
No.
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
Cynthia! Sure.
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
Yeah?
What did you say?
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
I'm not voting for you.
Remember my promise.
That wasn't your plan, was it?
You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
You're crazy.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.
Sir, your transmission's fading.
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
They're going to rob that bank.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
Hey, buddy...
How then?
Why?
She's pretty.
I'll be okay.
You're not pregnant, are you?
What else did he get?
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
You all right?
Yeah.
Hi.
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
I'll take it.
The people, Jabez -- the people.
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
You know that you're in my house.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
You are afraid!
Afraid ... of what?
I do -- and I think you should too.
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
You want me to go around --
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
Mary -- it's gone.
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
Jabez ...
You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Mary! Come back ...
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
You'll be a father any minute now.
Come in, Sheriff.
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
Why don't you?
The past six months.
How 'bout some Christmas music?
What's happening?
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
How about his job?
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
Hans, he killed by brother --
It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
I'm going to count to three...
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
How do you know?
'Roy'.
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
Al?  Al, you there?
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
I still feel like shit.
Powell?  What's going on?
Roy?
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
Jesus, you're the man!
What about the kids?
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
I don't know what I'm doing.
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
You're crazy.
You're really crazy.
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Yeah.
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
I got Sal.
Call me Sonny-boy.
Sonny-boy, one word?
What?
I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
Where's the back door?
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
What now, Sonny?
Special to me, too.
No you don't.
Are you a lawyer?
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
I didn't eat any pizza.
You were terrific, too!
How did you know your son was involved?
Did you always call him Junior.
Yeah.
Goddamn women...
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
But I want to know what you think.
We won't have to.

They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
There it is, Sal.  Sal?
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
Okay, when do I get them?
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
Okay, who's the head teller here?
Oh - Maria!
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
Oh my God, mother!
Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
What'll you do?  Come out.
Maybe...
You're news, Sonny ...
Who the hell is that?
<i>We gotta bring him in.</i>
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
<i>Did you get all four?</i>
Hello?
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
How did you meet Choco?
Can you tell?
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!
No. What's the big deal?
They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?
Get Cynthia on the line. <i>They changed the fucking font.</i>
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
Meeka's white blood cell count is dropping fast.
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
Yes?
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
And I--we--want some Black people up.
What?
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.
You the man.
No, you the man.
What makes Sammy run?
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
...peanuts.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
Jade, you're late.
Mookie, get offa da phone.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
We both do.
No.  What are you gonna do?
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
You a blue-moon fool.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
Shaddup, Vito.
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.
Fuck you and stay off the phone.
I know this.
Pino, relax, will ya.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Depends how you define 'new'...
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
Okay.
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
I know I am, Mom.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
One day they'll find a cure.
Yeah, he's a pirate.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
She did not.
Will not.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
I bet you want your head scratched.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
Who?
You certainly did.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
Hey, look. Ice cream.
You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
I... found that rock.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Guys, this is much better.
You take her.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
TURK, what are you doing here?
Yes, what?
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
What?
Well, something stinks.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
Senior year. My little boy. Who woulda thunk it?  You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't say it enough, but I'm proud of you son.
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
I am strong!
We start our own class?
You said "aloha" twice.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
What?
Oh, just like the President.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
Paul!!  Paul!!
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
The Water of Life.
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
What can be done has been done.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
I have no next picture.
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
Bela, what happened?!
I didn't feel well...
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Huh?
I don't know.  Where?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
I've never seen anything like him!
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
And who may you be?
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
You met Basil Rathbone!
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Goddamn landlord.
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.
Would that work?
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
Oh.  Congratulations.
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
I just picked them up on the way over...
Did you find it boring?
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
Who's Dr. Tom?
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
I don't know.
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
You're <u>sure</u>???
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
No! Do they show you having sex?
Come on...
Yeah, so... ?
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
Excuse me.
Cool.
How you doing, Ed?
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
What if Shari's the dream?
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
Yes?
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Who?
Al!
What?
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
Send him away.
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
He had girlfriends!
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
Could've been a nurse?
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
Oh God. What hospital?
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
She left.
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Ha!
Leave. Go.
I wish my stepfather was here.
Shari...
No. Who?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
You're in show business?
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
What's the dif --
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
No -- keep it.
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
That girl's an idiot.
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
That's the point -- this could change things.
What does that have to do with... ?
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
What d'you got?
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
What do you mean?
So what brings you here?
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
Where to?
You'll be fine.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
And when did you do it?
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
You're there.
Yeah.  I'm here.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
I know.
Thought what?
Yes.  But do you know?
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
Did they deserve it today?
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
What work?
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
Are you Pierce Patchett?
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Should I?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
I never truck with no sissies!
Believed what?
Dogs got no reason to live.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
I... No.
No.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --
And now you'll provide them.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
So what's the point?
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
Decorated?
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
Lynn Bracken.
Not good enough.
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
I'm curious about you.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
I'll take your word for it.
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
What's wrong, Trash?
Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
I'll come straight there.
Really?
You knew the deal. No contact.
That's who they are.
You're crazy.
What <u>is</u> that?
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
I didn't use my name.
Sorry.
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
I didn't use my name.
Who?
You're driving.
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Drive.
No he won't.
Same thing?
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
What if--
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
I think she'll like this very much.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
Anything at all?
This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
It's not real...  That's not me.
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
Stacy, don't hang up.
Good.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
What is it?
Is it over?
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
It tastes like fish.
It is fish.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
When do I get to meet him?
Yes.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
I gotta go.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
You're wrong.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
Hey!
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen--
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.
Some of 'em.
He's kidding.
Where's mom?
Where've you been?
No.
No, but they took my blender.
Jerry--
I need help.
How can I reach you?
You would?
Why not?
Fuck you.
I said fuck you.
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
The originals?
We believe?
Lyle?!
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
Daskylus…
Hello!  Good morning.
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
Pardon?
I do not.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
Yes.  Absolutely.
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
Do they know them?
No.
Don't.
Now.
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almásy nods.
This is - what is this?
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
We've got to get you out of here.
Have you seen Katharine?
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
What did you think you were doing in his tent?
Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
I believe I'm rather late.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but…  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
How are you?
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
Or was it Toronto?
No.
What?  How could he have?  When?
Well, then ask him his name!
Buon' giorno.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
Me?
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
The rest meant nothing to me.
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
To arm-twisting.
Candaules…you're laughing at me.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
Are you asleep?
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
He needn't disturb you.
Yes?
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Your friend?
This is Captain McGann.
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
I'm not sewing anything else.
What do I do?
No. But he hands them over.
I'll always go back to that church.
He's gone, hasn't he?
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
What's happening?  Am I needed?
How awful.  What will you do?
Darling, Peter says I could stay…
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
Why didn't I think of that?
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
Too late now.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
I don't want to waste your time.
Seems I am.
I'll call an ambulance.
I've got something...
You...you can't.
I know.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
Fine. What do I do?
Give him the card.
He says they turned the card down.
What about your bags?
We're doing this together. We're partners.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
Why don't we take oxygen?
Did I hear a car?
So how long to pop the floor?
That's it. We're ready.
Won't take any time.
To us. To the Mask.
Aren't we all.
We're working.
Ready?
Well...What are we doing?
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
Parachute.
No way to take another day or two?
You shouldn't have.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
The disc is still in there.
--You're a cop.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Gin, really.
In the van.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
Yes it does.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
Yes?
I'll say.  Holy moley.
They did?
What's chromium?
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --
You do know how to do that, don't you?
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
Excuse me?
Oh, yeah?
Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
Hey.  I like working with you.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
What kind of things come up?
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
What's a demur?
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
No one's taking anything --
Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Say you were wrong.
How do you know that?
And you were told to destroy those?
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
What kind of chromium is it?
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
You've been reading for hours.
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
Whose number do you need?
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
Great.  Another deadbeat.
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
And I miss you.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
He will learn patience.
... Luke, you must not go.
And that is why I must go.
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
Our destruction?  Who?
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
You, too, golden rod.
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
Yes, Your Highness?
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
Not you?
Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
What are you afraid of?
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
You look silly.
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
No.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
You're part of the mining guild then?
It's a lovely outpost.
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
What'd you say?
What?
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
But tell me why ...
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
Did you call the Zoo?
They're...pretending to dress.
Zira, are you mad?
With food?
Humans?
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
You told me he was dead.
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
Don't lie to me.
All right, so I made another deal.
Shut up, Plissken.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Where'd they go?
Stop the damn car.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Yeah, kinda.
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
Snake - what is it?
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
You saved me from the arrow...
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
In the great book.
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
I'm going.
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
I?
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
What honey?
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
Oh great, anything else?
Dinner at the White House.
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
What didn't he tell you?
No, she was heavily sedated.
Yes, I go now.
She is going to be well?
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
Fine thank you.
A stimulant.
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Are you sure?
Have you told him what's happening?
Um........Stuff.
We'll see when we get home okay.
Who's Captain Howdy?
Regan, why are you reading that?
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Oh, Christ.
I came to say goodbye.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
Did you do that?
Do it again.
Quod nomen mihi est?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Is that too tight?
No.
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
Amen.
Have we met?
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
It's possible. Possible however…
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
No I probably wouldn't.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
Yes.
I don't know.
It's our goddamn car!
Twelve years.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
Honey ...
What's wrong with them?
How many?
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
Oh.
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
What's wrong with it?
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
Jack...
You're their uncle.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
Says who?
What's with Charlie?
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
Jack.
You're getting cold feet about this.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
Get out of here.
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
Yeah.  Something.
Hey, Frank.
Day.  Wednesday.
Last?
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
Okay.
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
How dare you say you love me.
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
You could've come.
What?
Just until we find another girl.
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
I don't know.
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
Go ahead.
I'll take the Mallory.
Charlie called.
Five years ago.  November.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
This is where the auditions were.
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
When?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
We're a team.  We work together.
Changed?
What's he talking about?
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
Right.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
I said I was sorry.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Virgins.
What's with you two?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
What's with you guys?
Huh?
How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
Yes, well, they are.
I'll call you.
Funny job.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
Frank works hard.
Where's egghead?
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Nothing.
I'm not upset.
All I said was you were good.
He had a mind that escalated things.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
Jack.
Sounds big.  What's he do?
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
John.  It's good to see you.
Fine.  You?
Huh? Oh, no.
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
My place.
Why would he need more?
Were you there to catch me?
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
What more proof do you need?
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
Go on.
Now what?
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
Not anymore.
What are you going to do, Castor?
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
When did you start smoking?
Castor's escaped!
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
As much as ever.  Nothing.
The hospital.
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
You're wearing your suit --
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
-- Yes.
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Jack, are you okay?
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Who did?
I think I could figure it out.
Very nice. What is it?
We’re friends, aren’t we?
I’m having kind of a bad day.
So could you write down her exact address?
It’s me, Jack...
Yes you do...
Like I said, it's a business deal...
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesn’t work like that and I can’t tell you why.
That’s it?  That’s all I get?!  A glare?!
You can’t do this. You can’t keep coming in and out of people’s lives, messing things up...
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
Need a nurse?
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
For us, Kate.
Because that’s where I live.
What are you doing?
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Do what?
Excuse me?
Look, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I was such a saint before and I’m such a prick now.  Maybe I’m just not the same guy I was when we got married...
Surprise.  We’re pregnant...  Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
How was the game, honey?
Jack.
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
This is New York City, it’s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours aren’t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
I promise, Jack...
Jesus, Jack...
It’s because I’m shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Peter Lassiter...
Can I help you?
Last night was great...
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
Ben.  Are you okay?
It's about to be a broken face.
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
About me?  How sweet.
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
You look like an eighties rock band.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What do you mean "complete"?
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
What are you doing --
They're ready for you, sir.
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
But I'm not done with the machine --
You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
There were a lot of variables to consider --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Victor, I'm sorry I --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
You said it was urgent.
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
And take a little trip with them...
You mean <I'm> going along?
Just one, General...
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
Listen...the Heart.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
Shouldn't you answer that?
Open it! Open it before they get here!
What can we do?
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
You left something out.
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
Sort of.
Any reserve air?
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
Where is Pancakes Hause?
...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?
One of us pays the other for half.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
...Who's Jean?
Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.
...Blood has been shed.
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
Oh, he's adorable.
Yah, he -
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
A subconscious-type thing.
...Yah, okay...
Dad, I really think we should call the cops.
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Yah, but -
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Jerry Lundegaard.
Jerome Lundegaard?
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Good day, sir.
Shep said 8:30.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Yah, pretty good.
We're good to loan in.
No, see -
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
Uh-huh.
No, that's okay.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
No, no, that's fine.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
I'm sorry.
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Uh-huh.
...Hello?
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
We've got a -
...How's the paintin' goin'?
Not on your feet too much?
Your mallard?
It's terrific!
And his wife?
Oh, my.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Really, what's that?
Yes?
Dynamite?
I'd like to thank the academy...
I'll expose you.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
I want that.
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
I found a new one.
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
What are you talking about?
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
Where?  Here?
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
Chloe's dead.
Do you care?
Guy or girl?
What?
Answer the question!
Say my name!  What's my name!?
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
Who's this?
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
What?
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
Tell the other person how you feel.
This is how I met --
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
Well, uh... great.
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
Huh?
No, I...
What?
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
The fight.
If you could fight any celebrity?
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
Unbelievable, huh?
You're sure?
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
Yes, I promise.
Look at your hand.
Look...
I want to hear the truth.
"Too young?"
"Applicant?"
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
What about them?  They're lunatics.
Why... why... why... ?
Why are you doing this?!
I swear on my life, I won't...
Look at me...
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?
It's free to all.
Yes, it is.
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Would you rather be dead?
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
Should we knock?
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
What?
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
What's going on here?
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
I tried calling last night but your father --
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
I guess so.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
Yeah?
I'm... really sorry.
Right. April 25th.
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
You know what to do.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
And don't pass on the right.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
What are you doing?
What's that?
You read me, Brewer?
I've seen worse places.
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Are you okay?
Invulnerable.
I know.  I go with you.
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
Am I out of here?
There were treating me like a headcase.
Those men are all dead.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
Fine.
Really?
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Most men are.
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
He's not a moron.
And who's Lydia?
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
It was a crime.
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
Now what?
No... thanks... Listen --
They're --  -- What?
<u>What</u>?!
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Excuse me...
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
You're not going to play it again.
Now, now.
I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...
I'm not.
Yes.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
Hey, mack!
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
I just can't look at you.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
No.
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Robert, I have to tell you something...
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Do you want some gingerbread?
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
Hello...
That's dangerous, you know.
Why?
Wait...
Serious, that's what's important to you?
I have to talk to you.
Will you let me talk to you, please?
Yes.
That'll make you happy.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
No, it's okay.
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
Not now, I'm busy
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
Wussup?
Hi.
Remember me, from the pool?
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
Wha'?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Which one?
How do I know you're not lying.
Not really.
Would you like me to change anything?
I wasn't asking.
Creasy, how old are you?
Hey, what are you doing?
Fletch, this is dumb.
Fletch.
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
My God, you're serious.
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Just relax.
Okay. Some idea.
I think I’d rather have drugs.
Jesus.
My pleasure.
Nothing. They're still there.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
Right.
John Ultramalensky, right?
Because we can't.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Where am I going?
That's right.
'Magic' today, huh?
Shoot.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
Who is it?
You were in the war?
Can I ask you a question?
Depends on the question.
Are you still in love with Alan?
He never sees them and I never met them.
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
No.
What is this....
Bastard.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
I'm terrified.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
Your call is come through.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
The door was unlocked.
I commend him on his choice.
What?
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Gummy and two cops...
Utah?
You were going to can me, right?
Not really?
Frieda's boss.
Mrs. Stanwyk!
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
Spooky.  I'll process her.
You going to be okay?
Hello, Ford...
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
How much?
You gave it to the girls for one.
What?  Jesus, tell me!
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
This is boring, guys.
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
Ick.
I can't kill this kid's father...
When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
It's me.
Who's my real father, man?
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
I'm off it!
The case!
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
I knew your father.  He was quite...
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
It doesn't have to be like this?
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
'Bye, Johnny...
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Well try, okay?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
It has to be by the end of this week.
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
What happens to the schedule?
I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
Yeh?  Who else?
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
Who stuck up the laundromat?
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
Drink this.
Who is that guy?
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
Yeah.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
It looks open on the other side.
Hey, bud.
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
Did he?
He did.
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
Hey, bud.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
Uh huh...
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
Oh my god.
Dad...?
You're still my Little Chief, right?
No wait, don't go!
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
On the job?
When?
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
Are you alright"?
What?  What is it?
She just died, your mother just died?
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
What do I tell them?
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.
John, you there?
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
You work too hard, John.
You have the right to speak to an att --
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
Breakfast?
I vote for me.
Barely.
Will you come with me?
What's this?
What?
Look what I found.  Remember these?
What d'ya got in there?
Please... be cool.
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Whaddya mean?
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
Nancy.
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
Which is?
He didn't say anything?
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
The what?
I know who you are.
I'm kind of busy right now...
Look, I don't want your money!
Ed...
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Okay.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
Tell me!
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
Why didn't you tell me?
What are you doing?
Oh my God, Steven.
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
Randy, c'mon!
Well?
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
Until I hear the truth.
I know what it sounds like.
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
Really?
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
What's that?
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
I demand to know what is going on...
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Everything okay?
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
So, are you having fun yet?
Did you have an accident in the lake?
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
Can he really take us home?
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
Rennie...??
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
But Rennie...
I used to drive a taxi.
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
Crosstown.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Say it again.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
I say we go.
No, we're not.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
Paisley Porter.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
This is how we've managed to last.
We're able to surprise each other.
Because we're completely mismatched.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
Yes.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
What do we want?
What's sexy?
All right. What's been going on?
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
That's very lovely actually.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
Who is it?
If it's you, what are you doing here?
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
I know, Pop.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
You're charming the boy.
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
Why?
I was educated by nuns.
Yes.
Yes.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
I hear good things about the new play.
So do I. Over and over.
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
The fact is, I have to get going.
I don't know.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
I am your wife.
Please! You're being foolish!
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
You're an ambitious man.
It's beautiful.
Are you going to walk all the way?
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
You mean a general strike?
They're sparing no one, I see.
Will you have a glass of sherry?
Have you read his magazine?
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
What a pity.
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
We believe we have a suspect.
Six one.
You okay, Jerome?
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
You had to be a right-hander.
That's not the point.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
What makes them think that?
In a corridor.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
You may as well invite her here.
What do you think?
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
I'd have to bleach my hair.
Why don't we say we were together?
Where?
You'll be next.
Of course I think about it every day.
Let's walk.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
A year is a long time.
The name?  For the certificate.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
I'll take care of my end.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
Assumed name... Houston.
Really?
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
Promise you won't laugh.
What about the bank?
There are three men dead.
What do you want to do?
That would be the first time.
I don't want to hear it.
Sounds good.
Who was it?
That's right.
Hope you get to where you're going.
Can I help you?
You were with him?
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
'Bout five thousand.
And I keep my mouth shut?
That's what I want.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
Who?
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
What did you do?  Albert?
Oh ay?
I know.
What?
Why?
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
Nicer than most.
Do you?
Who?
Oh, do you?
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Then he must have pulled her.
Now tell me the truth.
Yeah.
How'd you know Albert?
Where you off to?
How many?
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
I'm sorry.
They bloody hurt me.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
Do us a favour?
You coming back?
It would be. If they were still living.
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Not going, Jack?
Gerald wants to see him first.
You're not seeing me?
I'll see you, then.
Polacks and deadbeats.
...they hold on to their money...
You had to, yeah.  Why?
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
You ever get 'em?
You had one you'd know it.  Patel. They keep coming up.  I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen.  They're lonely, something.  They like to feel superior, I don't know.  Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like it. Christ...
What?
All of, they got you on this "board..."
Some contest board...
Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
You don't ax your sales force.
Somebody...
Yes.
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
What could somebody get for them?
How many leads have we got?
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
You haven't talked to him.
As an idea.
Talking about it as a...
Well.  Well...
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
Did you talk to Graff?
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
In the abstract...
Do you need five grand?
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
And why is that?
I, you know, they should be insured.
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
I am?
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
No, who?
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
Excuse me, sir...
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
What two?
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...no...
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
Murray...
...you talk to Murray...
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
...they kicked out.
What are we going to say?
I saw the board.  You've got four...
Why?
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
Why I don't...
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
What?
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
John: John:...my daughter...
Shit.
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
Shelly...!
Fuck you, Dave...
"Always be closing..."
Which...
Mm.
Ricky, I...
Yes.
Mmmm...
Lingk.  James Lingk.
I've got to talk to you.
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
The check wasn't cashed?
The power to negotiate.
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
And the check is...
It's nothing.
Fuck you.
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
Have a good trip.
They didn't get my contracts.
They took some of the con...
I have the stuff from last year's...
...you want to go out today...?
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
Three.
Yes.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
John...
To do business.
I'm not hungry.
That's right.
What took so long?
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
How are the kids?
I want to talk to you, Michael.
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
We're making an investment in Havana.
Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.
What's that?
...Who?
I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
What?
Within the compound will be fine.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
What do you mean gone?
Yes.
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
Do you gamble?
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Is he related to the witness?
I'm going to the market.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
I had no idea...
Why don't you sit down?
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
However I can help you...
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
I know.
When do we talk?
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.  But I have the idea from sources...  ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana.  In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality.  The license, which is now in Klingman's name.
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
I'm talking about Italians!
It still hurt.  A lot.
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
You ever been married, Hanna?
But I didn't do this!
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
Football in college.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
Do you mind?
This David's a friend?
No.
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
I'm not, you know.
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
What happened?
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
Everybody has stories to tell.
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
You're the one who started it.
Just go.  Please.  Why don't you go?
Good afternoon, Clayton.
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
The Great War?
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
Do you mind?
I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
Should you be drinking in your condition?
Yes.  Perfectly.
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
No.  I expect you can't.
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
One likes to live simply.
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
Quite.
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
What are you doing here?
It seems she neglected to mention it
What do you mean -- ?
You got no choice. It's over.
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
When'd you get to town, Raines?
Where you been, anyway?
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
Yeah.
What's the matter?
You ever feel bad about any of this?
How's it going -- ?
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
What are you doing back?
oh.
Hey, Kip, what's up?
What do you say, Toby?,
You goin' home?
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
"About what?"
He's gonna kill you -- !
You?
Me.
You don't think so, huh?
"Shadow games?"
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
What?
Take it back, Freb --
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
On account of Mitch?
What's wrong with her -- ?
No ... ?
Ready -- ?
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
What about The Club ... ?
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
What -- ?
No we don't -
What happened to Sway?
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
How come ... ?
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Billy, how are you?
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
Then you're safer in here.
Keep 'em coming.
You want the melon?
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
Yeah.
I want to talk to Jimmy.
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
You want a partner?
Who's she talking to?
When's the arraignment?
Why not?
How's the woman?
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
No, I had to talk him down.
Ah, history I think.
You caught that, huh?
--That isn't funny--
Yah, that is a nice ass.
Some other guy?
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
That's one aspect of what we do.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
Yeah, can I help you?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
Fuck do you want?
Half-red, half-black--
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Yes.
Good to see you.
Can we do it at my office?
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
Who?
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
--I don't have any anger at you--
He won't be a failure!
So I hear you're taking some time.
I don't know. India maybe.
About thirty million to one.
Who is he?
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
What?
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
What did you think?
This is a real piece of shit.
Tell me what you really think.
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
No.
Well, are you going out again?
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
Do you think you're alone?
They're all dead.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
I just want you to know, Sean...
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
What?
So you just want to use me and go?
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
I have twelve big brothers.
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
Exactly.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
They don't come over here that much.
Clearly.
Just for fun?
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
You doin' the hirin'?
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
Ready, Ma?
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
Want to work?
Four.
Two and a half cents.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
*You* find out, I can't.
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
I ain't no preacher anymore.
I ain't gonna run.
You're right!
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
Goin' far?
Lookin' for a job?
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
I stay in my own yard.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
I like the tent better.
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
Pa! Shh!
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
Sometimes they do.
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Didn' you get no sleep?
Since before they stopped us las' night.
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
They know what--this fella looks like?
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
Here we go!
But what does *that* prove?
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
Now you done it! You busted it!
Morning.
You people looking for work?
You do not.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
It's me. Martin Blank.
I want to be an actor.
What's your business?
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
That's part of it.
It's always the little things.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Yes.
Shoulda brought my gun.
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Like love?
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
That's probably a good idea.
I'm staying here.
Come on.
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
How do you know?
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
How was your day, today, sir?
Do you like the people you work with?
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Lisbon?
He using her.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
All of it?
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
This is not good.
It's fine.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
What's a revival tent?
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
You have a headache?
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Paul?
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
This is Annie MacLean.
The answer's no.
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
How long did you live here with your wife?
Son?
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
I am comfortable.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
Oh, honey... What happened?
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
What about him?
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
What?
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
Did he tell you that?
You buckled up?  You cold?
Did you ask him to come visit?
I'll come.
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
Who's going to want me now?
David?
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
I'm sorry.
I love you.
Doing what?
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Take your time.
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
It's so cruel.
No. He had the choice.
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
I'd love to go there one time...
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
Sounds like something Tom would say.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Diane!
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
Don't you go to school?
I can't... not yet...
Grace, I need you to come with me.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Jude, you okay?
You're looking fit.
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
Where did you learn all this stuff?
Secret Service!
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
Damn!
One-handed!
Did you talk to him?
Dead?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
No. No one special.
Talk to me.
Yo, showtime, showtime!
They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
Yes!
That's a nice score for a girl.
It's too much machine for you.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
And you have to smile.
Okay. I'll copy it.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
I know, I know who wrote it.
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
Ready?
You would have looked better.
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
Good.
My name is the Plague.
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
Never fear. I is here.
Yo, what's up?
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
I don't want to go to jail for this.
Hello, operator services.
Purpose of visit?
You're late.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
I don't know Brady.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
How do you know their not?
Why wasn't I notified?
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Come on Rachel.
Coming.
Jamie!
We'll hear sirens soon.
That's all the windows, Dad.
You remember Lindsay don't you?
I don't want to look pushy.
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
Why?
Its true, Sheriff.
Something?
This is starting to spook me.
It's over.
These kids aren't likely to forget.
Car trouble?
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Hi, Dad. What happened?
Why didn't you wait for me?
Well, are we still on for tonight?
I have a place for that.
Hello?
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
You still spooked?
He was watching me.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
Wait a minute here...
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
My parents won't be back till ten.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
What do we do?
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
Sure...
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
There was no one outside.
The bogyman!
Are you sure?
If you say so.
Are you really interested?
Oh, yeah.
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
What?
No, he called late last night.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
Hmm?
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
We're actresses.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
Oh, what, what do you do?
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
Could you--
...with the affiliates.
We--
Like, uh...?
Yeah.
Oh.  Well, I live--
No!  No...
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Oh.
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
Elliot!  Don't!
What are you doing?!
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
But it hasn't been forever. 
Aren't they great?
I know.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
I want one with you.
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
Why should I be afraid?
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
How are you?
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
How is everything?
Gee.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
Yeah.
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
Oh, he's such a loser!
Yeah, can you believe it?
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
Well, that...th-that's fine.
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
Oh, so loosely.
Well--
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
We didn't hit it off.
Good.  How are you?
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Well...
Yeah.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Nobody ever said it.
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
A reward...
I'm going to tell you later....
What have they got you doing?
That would adversely impact my income.
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
How crazy is that.
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
They got that kind of money?
Not with any certainty we...
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
If you would see him monument, look around you.
What do you want me to do?
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
No.  And...
No, no, of course not.
I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, ¥our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
No. 
Said what?
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
...Franklin.
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
...I'm sorry....?
Thank you, Cordell.
...might I make a suggestion...?
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
Don't shoot yourself.
Why?
Fine, thank you, but
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
What're they on about?
...I feel that...
Tell me why...?
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
...sir...?
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
Howdy Pouty.
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Mine!
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
I think your passion is terrific.
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special.
Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?
Have you ever thought of instead                            ] of making children more equipped                            ] for reality, we should make reality                         ] more equipped for children?                                 ]

What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
It's not my style, okay?
Gee, thanks.
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
Because you're an idiot.
All right.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
You going to eat this?
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
How was the funeral?
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
That's three things.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
 Got an A, Mum!
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
You have to let me go!
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
But, we're all going to Heaven!
To be known as He!
I'm coming with you.
Isn't it beautiful!
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
I understand, I think. Other women?
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
Sorry.
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
What?
GWEN?
Bret... what the fuck...?
Have we met?
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
That was cold...
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Two.
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Spanish kinda guys!
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
Underbelly!
Lie, you mean...
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Yes.
That's not what I mean...
We're piecing together different accounts and...
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
Saving people is not our job.  It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
She wants to quit?
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
Was that your dad?
I'm looking for some perfume.
Right.
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
Who doesn't?
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
About what?
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
Have you just plain asked him?
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
Honey --
Neil, calm down.
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
And it's a shorter commute.
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
What -- what are you doing?
I think it's time I came home now.
What?
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
Even cosier.
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
He had to come from somewhere.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
Central Park.
You sure?
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
Must you do that?
What?
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
How long is the voyage?
Yes.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
You can go first.
What do you think?
This cannot be.
Aye?
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
I remember you.
Are you a cop?
Corpses?
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
Where did you get it?
You're hurt.
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
New York is dangerous place.
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
Why not?
Be careful, Conner.
We found him this morning.
What are you doing?
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
What do you want to do?
The best.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
I understand.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
That woman's gonna call the cops.
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
That you, Talley?
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
Who else is here?
I don't know.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
Donuts here any good?
What if it goes south?
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
Ow!  Shit!
That big asshole nailed my windows.
You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
What happened?
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
That's enough.
Is something wrong with Jane?
Louise?
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
He says that his father's hurt.
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
Let it go, Captain.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
We've got to get those kids out of there!
Okay.
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Where's your gun?
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
What happened?
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
Name a price.
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Satellites.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders ‘we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.’ What do you think would have happened? No different.
I will see what I can do.
You said you had no whiskey.
You know what the Scottish call it?
We are better here.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Great, I really need a shower.
The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Why sir?
Call, sir?
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
Let's have dinner first.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Oh, my God!
Has Roger spoken yet?
You cannot go alone.
I had you transferred to Kigali.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
What does it matter.
I have to stay.
Twelve are dead.
He has taken the presidential suite.
What is this about no water?
Out? Where are you going?
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Jesus H. Christ!
Oh, for chrissake --
What are you playing here, Price?
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
I'm sorry --
-- what was he doing here?
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
What's in there?
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Oh. Jesus.
-- the stained glass --
Why not?
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
Where did it go?
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
...Jesus H. Christ.
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
You're hurting me.
-- the sadistic prick --
-- I pose you the same question --
I was in the middle of --
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
My wife. Where were we?
-- even if I give you a million as well?
What?
What is it??
-- the window and door grates --
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Blackburn's dead.
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
It might have been her mother.
I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
By freeing them.
What do these ingredients mean?
Don't play games with me, little girl.
Are we leaving mommy?
She says she's lonely...
Where is she?
She's down.  Help her...
What's he doing daddy?
He's blessing the house.
Good night Angel...
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
No.
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
She's gone!
Maura!
I think we should do it.
Maura.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
What are you getting at!
What's going to happen?
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
I'll do it!
Every day.
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
I don't know.  Maybe.
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
Wow.  Thank you.
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu--
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
Alex!
"You could be swinging on a star."
Did I miss anything?
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
I'm going to find out.
That's what you theenk.
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
Big girls don't cry-I-eye.
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
Don't I know you...
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
The Dancing Dingus!
The Hoop-dee-doo!
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
About seven minutes.
-- and she's dynamite!
Oh, no, really, I --
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
Smitty.
...You do?
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Now, Aim --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Barman! Set'm up, fella!
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
Terrific.
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
Yeah, but, buddy --
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
Geez, I --
Yessir.
Sir?
...This'll only take a moment.
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
Not that way! Through the door!
Ya don't say.
Yeah, tell me about it.
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
You mean a figurehead.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
That doesn't sound like him.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
I am not a frightened girl.
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
Good morning, Miss Connell.
You didn't drive her mad.
I told you.
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
You want to go?
I'm, uh, going to bed.
I... I think I am...
The turkey in?
Dinner in ten minutes.
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
If you're going to insult me --
In the car.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
Ready to go?
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
Hi dad.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Yeah?
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
I saw you on your bike today.
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
Social work?
Yes.
It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
See ya.
Do what?
What?
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
Did you tell Sandy?
When worlds collide.
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Are you his girlfriend?
He's dead.
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
Yes, sir.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
This murder was in the papers, right?
What about your shoulder?
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
What do you want to talk about?
He's just rattling your cage.
That's not what he thinks.
Will.
You heard me that time.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
You and Kay were like sisters?
What was?
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Down at the station?
But she was an attractive girl.
I suppose.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
Told you I could write an ending.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
Then so was mine...
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
No back-up.
Wild card.
Surely you know the one who made you...
Then there is nothing.
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
Your lover.
If you say so. You are innocent.
That's what the one who made me said.
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
Why always on this night?
It will grow back again!
Stop her Louis!
Does it?
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
Stop pestering me then!
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
Why does he call you that?
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
Claudia, you torture yourself.
Do you think I would let them harm you?
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
Dear God, what have I done?
And if I don't?
Read her thoughts.
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
Unless I make her one of us...
NO!!!
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
That's all past, Lestat.
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
It's over, I'm telling you...
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
That was heart attack time, Karla.
No means yes.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
Be careful, Julie.
There's no way to lock it.
Can't what?
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
What? What are you talking about? Where?
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Oooh, the mainland --
Guess the capital of Brazil --
Pretty cool bar.
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
Well, I'm in school and --
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
I'll go up and take a look at the General —- perhaps sit with him.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
Good night, Oliver.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
Shh——— it's all right -— I'll be all right.
Cathy —- how does it feel to have a father?
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
What would I be thinking?
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ——young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
I don't understand you.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
She's not too well.
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
We still don't know that it's the plague ——
She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
How did she die?
Theodosia --
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Then foreclose!
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
What?
Well, naturally. Of course.
I want you to take a good look at that face.
Who is it?
What's that book you've got there?
Thank you very much.
Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
Well then, how do you know?
Mother, you know, I can see right through you –– right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
Okay –– all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
Maybe you were born older, George.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
Got a match?
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
George.
I know, but . . .
Hello.
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Now look, did you buy anything?
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
I'd like to do that.
Have you notified the police?
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
In that place?
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
Hi.
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
Come on, you guys.
You coming up on him?
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
Tina!
I never heard of a 908.
In here.
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
What about that camera?
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
I can't let you take her out.
Untie that rope.
I'm going out there.
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
Because.
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
Oh, c'mon.
Michael.
I passed out, but I'm okay.
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
What else you got?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
There is nothing to discuss.
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
The whale's mouth?
And sound.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Where the hell were you?
Late.
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
Nothing, huh?
That's great.
We're alone.
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
Where the hell is Air One?
When?
Is that me?
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
I want you to meet my cousin.
She just likes to tease.  I think she really likes you.
Mike!  Are you going out?
Help!  Help!
Nope.
Anyone know what time it is?
Next week.
Nope.
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
Yeah.
Go on, you're tired.
What's your plan, Brody?
Till this opens, not our wedding.
My imagination isn't that good.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
Not enough loving.
Where's the rubber band?
Where are you going?
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
Michael...
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Here.
Fine piece of engineering.
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Recovering nicely.
They said you'd be here.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
Okay.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
Like hell!
You look like an orange worm.
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Why?
Why are you?
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
That's because I am the shark.
He's a young one.
Sure.  No problem.
I don't know, it depends.
Depends on big brother.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Hold still, damn it!
Yeah, well I didn't!
Make sure you put this back.
Yeah, poor bastard.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
How'd you do in school?
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean?  We were lucky to grow up the way we did.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
I wouldn't mind going down with her.
Daddy, why can't I...?
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way....
Like mother, like son....
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
You knew...?
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
At least he doesn't have a beard....
I'm hungry, Mom....
We don't want any....
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
I want you to get out of the water....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
All you all right?
You're having a good time....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
Sure you can....
It's just like driving a car....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
A big one....
Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....
What?
Want to go for a little ride?
You the architect?
Can't this thing go any faster?
I wish there was something I could do....
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
Hey!
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
They put bombs on dolphins....
How many?
Where is everybody?
We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?
Okay.. .we're done, man....
Okay...we got it together....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
And it's always worked?
How long has he been here...?
How come only me?
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
Shit....
I don't like the song.
Holy Christ....
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
That bad, huh?
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
Be my guest. What you got?
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
You gotta stop smoking ..
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
I haven't got it.
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
Why's she blind, Bro?
I'm going up to the institute.
Now?
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
No.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
That's bullshit,
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
No .. But we have a theory ..
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
What are you reading?
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
You said, you were in the bad lands?
How d'you know what I'm like?
Ross told me.
Which is what?
Why?
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
I know about alcohol, John.
I don't want them to arrest you.
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Could you just stop moving?
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
Yeah, I did.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
Same to you.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
So this break... is a break-up.
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
Good.
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
I'm sorry, I --
Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
Great word.  Towel?
No, I air-dry.
Forget it.  Forget it.
I'll get you some quick work --
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
The kid is amazing.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
I'm sorry I asked.
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
That's an answer.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
You gonna get that --
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
Do you think it goes all the way across?
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
Udesky.
It's not safe.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
Absolutely not.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
It looks intact.
We could co-write a paper.
I'd better get going.
A well-accepted theory.
Which one do you prefer?
We need to head for the coast.
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
I don't believe you.
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
Well, is he?
What is?
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
What?
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
Why did you come here?
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
Funded by whom?
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
But would we get the phones back?
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
How would we cut off the lysine?
Are you sure?
Carousel.
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
They smell.
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
The what?
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - a gizzard - -
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
The fences are electrified, right?
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
Dino droppings?
Faster, faster!
In a box under my seat.
Yeah.
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
These look kind of familiar.
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
I threw up.
Yes it is.
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
Why?
Machines hate you?
I know.
You're sure?!
- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
Tim, Tim, Tim....
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
You want to put in chain saws?
No, but...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
You have a map.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
Other guy?
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
Quite a circus.
What's going on?
_Krueger_...
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
None of that's true?
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
How do we prove it?
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
You saw him?
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
My assistants, I presume.
I read the one about the penal colony.
Did you?
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
You're detestable.
Well, I --
I do.
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
You almost married recently, didn't you?
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
-- Just doing our job.
... Why take me into your confidence?
... A piece of paper ...
It usually is.
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
All these in the last year?
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
Ludwig.
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
I'm sorry ...
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
What was it, Jack?
Did you fear for your life?
Why?
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
Sure dear, yes.
Yes?
I'd just be guessing.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
-- Yes.
My name's John Klute.
Honest?
-- Tuscarora --
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
You said it was!
It's kind of late.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
Is that all you have to say?
What am I supposed to say?
You and I -- a relationship.
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.
I am.
They don't scare me any more.
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
You must be discouraged.
That who?
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
What's in it?
Not unusual.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
I think she's trying that.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
No.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
Yes sir, we know he --
Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen...
Greatest...
On earth.
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
When is mommy coming back?
Mom, I mean dad...
I don't think so.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
Uh huh...
Mom--I mean, dad?
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
I don't recall.
Somewhere in between.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
What about Billy?
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
Wow!
What the hell is this?
Yes.
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
Things? What kind of things?
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Thelma, if I die--
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Uh, huh...
Huh.. .Hello?
Ted, what are you talking about?!
We must go, Holiness.
Mama, my story.
Will you buy the sheep for me?
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Holiness?
Oh, no. Where will he go?
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
How big is Tibet's army?
Roughly five thousand men.
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
What is the size of our army, now?
I am scared.
Good day.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
Things change, Kundun.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
But, I have no experience.
Like my mother.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
And what would he do come winter?
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
I do <u>not</u> like you.
I coulda shot you, you--
Yup.
He never said "go".
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
Right.
You talk to Bickerman?
Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
And how would we neutralize him?
How big do the bears get?
Why are you here?  Really.
I'm not making it up.
It's too dangerous for--
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
Well.  Goodnight.
He's mooing.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
Seconds.  Three, four.
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
They don't believe her.
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
Kelly--
Part of our research--
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
Myra.
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
Where?
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Who's the subject?
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
Starling -
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
Sometimes you do.
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
Yes.
Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
Your bleeding has stopped.
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
They all were.
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
All right, then tell me how -
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
What did you do?
Yes...! They were screaming.
So you ran away...
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
Yes. I'll tell you.
I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
What...?
Yes... I did.
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
Can we rest soon?
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
What is it?
Maybe...
My God, Alice.
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
Yes. Go ahead.
We were headed...
What?!
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Then what?
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
The honors of war?
Granted.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
They found this?
Was there such a thing?
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
Jesus Christ...
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
No!
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
Shit!  He sent them all.
Okay.
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
Personal effects...
If he had his blinkers on--
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
What is it?
What is it?
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Well, talk.
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
It's a Samoan pub.
Like antiques.
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
There are no others.
They were . . .
Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
They were going to pay, then?
You all right back there, mate?
Just carrying a bag.
That's no way to answer the phone.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
Er well, yes we do.
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
You will what?
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
At what, exactly?
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
How the fuck should I know?
So?
I don't know what the big deal is.
Leave your sister out of it.
So?
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
I am, sir.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
I do, sir.
You're dismissed, Private.
I'm feeling okay--
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
A .45--
Just wondering.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
Do I seem jumpy?
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
No. You?
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
Hey, it's the General.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
No sir.
The Trail of Tears.
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
But they were Indians themselves.
That guy who got shot--
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
Homework?
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Cliff--
Hey, Mikey--
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
We been through this before--
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
Black Seminoles?
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Es muy lindo, su coche--
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.
Seems like we have another one every week.
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
--Santiago.
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
I got an idea what happened.
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
We're building up tourism, Sam--
The Perdido thing?
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
Mami, how old were you when my father--
He was killed.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
Not if I can help it.
And when my father was Sheriff?
It's Saturday.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
How much you got left?
Well, you were working there--
He's all yours.
He hates me.
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
Pilar--
Yeah.
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
Yeah--
I been working on a few things.
They got telephones.
Gotta be in person.
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
You think we need a new jail?
I haven't seen anybody come by.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
I know you?
Name's Otis.
Otis what?
Who?
Nix.
My life was too weird for her.
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
How'd you spell that again?
What do you mean, "all of us?"
And are you afraid?
Did your husband know Quaid?
You don't?
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
He's good.
Why?  Because he had you?
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
Harry-?
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
Trickery and divinity.
Whose is the car?
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
What's the difference?
I like to know why things happen.
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
Shit...
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
For what?
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
It's me betrayed him.
You think I'm an asshole.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
Fuck you.
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
No!
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
Hello?
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
Philosophy.
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
Really?
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
No, yes, it does...
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
Four.
Where's your husband?
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
What?
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
What?
How'd it go today?
You smell weird.
See you later.
Yeah.
Its bad for you.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
Oh, the record company sent these...
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
I missed you.
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
I'm still shaking.
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
It's nothing.
No, I wasn't, actually.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
Father, I'm right here.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
Two negatives always make a positive.
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
I'll bet.
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
Nothing yet.
What are these?
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
You know what?  You can go.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
Yeah.
Thanks for handling this.
She told me she killed them.
Hi.
How is he?
There you go.
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
That's ridiculous.
She's alright.
So you're still breast-feeding?
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
I can take it.
Wait...
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
It means a lot that you came by.
To do what you love.
I don't know sometimes.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
How'd you get him to say yes?
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
You shoot like a girl.
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
You were trying to make me look bad.
Thanks.
So how come you could play basketball?
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
None of your business.
So how about a little one-on-one?
Give me the ball.
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
he's just playing, Q...
Hey.
Talk to your new girlfriend.
Stay!
What?
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
So...how's the knee?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
You asked me what was missing.
you woke me up to tell me that?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
I'll play you.
You're out of your mind.
Zeke.
With who?
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
We still have to go?
We were just studying.
How was your game?
Said he'd be home later.
Sorry.  You okay?
Whose truth are you talking about?
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You work too hard, Pop.
Sorry.
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
You ok?
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
Hello?
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
What kind of Cancer?
...what the fuck is this...?
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
No.
You don't have a boyfriend?
No.
Bit messy.
You take cream or sugar?
Yeah.
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
You won't.  You won't have to.
Ok, ok. I'm back.
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Bye, bye, Claudia.
I'm sorry, Claudia.
Please, yes.
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
No, no.
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
Well.
-- you the resident here?
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
I want a shot of tequila too.
I don't know.
I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
It's ok --
DADDY, FUCK, DADDY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME. DON'T GET MAD AT ME --  JUST GIMME YOUR MONEY.
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
I was listening --
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
Well --
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
I don't know.
He has Phil right now.
Yeah.
I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
-- memory?
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
Graduation?
I'm gonna start rolling --
Let's talk about --
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
This isn't meant --
Around here.
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
...this close...
Where does that name come from?
And "Frank?"
Kind of.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
...ok...
I AM CALM.
I don't have to answer your questions.
I didn't do anything.
And what about screaming?
You on any medication?
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
Are you ok?
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
Did you tell her?
It'll take the pain away.
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
I'll answer anything.
Just once.
What about now?
...say it, Jimmy...
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
Yes you do.
I'm sorry.
No.
What's MOW?
They look pretty smart, I think.
Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
....it's alright....
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
Phone number.
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
Yeah.
yeah.
That's it.
What do you do?
I need this one.
Hi.
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
What had you to do with this, Mother?
What is that?
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
But -- what is he doing?
Poor Phillippe!
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
No!  Stop --
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
What do we do now?
Thanks, but not for me.
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
Where are you going?
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
What is that?
Are you hungry?
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
Forgive?!
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
Eh?
Exactly why it should be given away.
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
Captain Doyle?
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
Cooperate?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
Did you hit him?
What?
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Gotta come from somewhere...
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
Mind if I turn out the light?
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
No.  A witness.
No...I'm in some trouble...
Jesus, man...
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
I've got a better idea...
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
Don't you guys ever knock?
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
That was Peterson upstairs.
That's when it happened?
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
How much do you know?
What else did you keep out of the papers?
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
What's one way?
See? You do know something about him.
Tell me now.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
Something Lecktor said.
What's that?
It does, doesn't it?
Tonic will be fine.
That was nice of you to think of that.
No.
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
Was I in an accident?
Do you see?
Please, no.
Are you a man?
Do you have it?
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
In a holding cell.
Linda King's desk.
And you said?
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Blue is cold.
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
Then why?
I have to go back to Birmingham.
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Mama was probably asleep.
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
You going back down to Florida after?
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
That's right.
Meet point's up ahead!
Yeah...
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
I figured I'd ask you...
We don't know that.
And Hobbs died?
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Why should I tell you?
Pray tell.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
What were the yards like?
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
You have to do it.
I refuse.
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
What, you don't think I can beat him?
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
What do you mean?
Why Memphis?
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
You don't know the real me.
How can you be so casual??!
You're NOT DYING!
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
Then your father's a wimp.
Then your father's a wimp.
No!  Andy, don't do it --
It's so dirty.
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
Sir, do you have a problem?
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
It is apparently not working.
"Burlesque"?
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
Why is he saying these things?!
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
Who is it?
Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
What are you doing?
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
The Matrix?
What truth?
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
Why do my eyes hurt?
When?
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
This isn't real?
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
Of the Resistance.
And she knows what?  Everything?
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
And you still believe I'm the One?
That vase.
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
What?
They're watching you, Neo.
What the hell is this?!
From what?
Why?
Yes.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
No, you're not.
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Are you all right?
Morning.  Did you sleep?
Where is it?
How?
Operator.
I'll be all right.
Neo!
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
May God be with you.
Get out of here before this really goes up.
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
Hey, come on...
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
What happened to you Flash?
Didn't show up.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
Keep your mouth shut.
Shut up!
That bad, huh?
OK, ok...
What's a'matter?
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
Chinese food?
His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
It's all right.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
Just keep him quiet.
How much?
Can you spare it?
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
That's your name?
Dinner?  Again?
Did you speak to the Governor?
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
What, honey?
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
Yeah, but --
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
...See you tomorrow night.
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
Why yes, thank you.
Yes.
What an odd pairing.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
No, I don't --
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
Did you just hear something?
I am now.
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
You're overthinking it --
Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
Make it go 'way.
My Doctor Lady?
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
Thanks.
C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
Oh goodness, no.
Yes...
'To bed'?
You first.
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
And is your heart beating strangely?
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
We know all that we need to know --
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
When you go, I go.
Well, thank you for letting me know.
What do you mean?
Joe --?
Can you keep a secret?
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Excellent.  What is it?
And more.
Hello, Bill.
What's okay?
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
'Spooning'?
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
Thanks.
I was just asking, Bill.
Say again?
I'm sorry, Bill --
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
I guess you have your reasons.
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
It just occurred to me --
I'm sorry, I --
'The one' to do what?
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
Drew's aboard?
How did you know?
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
Bravo.
What?!
It'll come back, Daddy.
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
Then what is it?
Where's Joe?
This is crazy --
Are you relieved?
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
Why not?

MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.

69.
Burt.
Amnesia?
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
You think you can bargain with me?!
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
Tell me about her again.
I wasn't helping you for money.
Yes.
Did you?
Kill him.
His name was Jimmy.
Somebody's come. Already.
Calls himself Dodd.
What does he want?
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
You tell me.
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
Yup?
John Gammell?
I don't think so.
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
Why are you following me?
I don't know. See, I have this condition.
This is a drug deal?!
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
My wife wasn't diabetic.
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
What was it for?							   *
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
Make it 40%.
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
Okay.
What's "nothing"?
So where's the best place for mojitas?
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Died in childbirth, having me...
That's right.
Cost less.  That's the point.
Available cash is not an issue for us...
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
What's the best fortune you ever got?
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
Really?
When?
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
What'd Neptune tell you?
Stevens?
Where we meeting 'em...?
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
You're not makin' a move on her...?
Then you should.
Detective Crockett.
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."
Where's Riccardo?
On the phone.
Yes.  What's up?
Meaning...?
This the load you lost a while back?
Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty...
Beg pardon, ma'am?
Lotta rich women back there...
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
Who?
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
Gin's okay.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Ready for hard work, son?
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
Yeah.
History, man, history. How much?
What?
Anybody bitten?
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
Shit.
For the money... )
Sure.
About ten kilometers.
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
What's your father do?
Girlfriend?
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
Where is it?
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
Work, work, work, that's all do
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
Who?
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
Weird shit...?
And a right.
The kid...
I pull.
What are you putting that crap on me for?
Which way?
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
Thought it was my week for that.
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
Don't.
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
It's no use! They know we're in here!
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
I'm not much of a critic.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
You want to read it?
No, what is it?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
Just leave it, all right?
What is it?
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Did they win?
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
You won.
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
A change of plans?
Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
Where?
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
..or hard wired..
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
And the check's in the mall.
Do you know me?
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
Twice.
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
And then what?
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
Yes, I gathered as much.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
Yes, he knew.  Just..
..I'm fine..and you?
Nekhorvich's boss?
Let's start from the inside out.
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
You have Bellerophon.
Do I?
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
To friends.
That's S.O.P..
But why tell us?
You knew about Jim?
All ten million.
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
This is Kittridge.
I donít think so.
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
What makes you trust me?
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
That depends.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Mm - Hmmm...
Where exactly is it?
Zero body count.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
Loud and clear.
Try it again.
I always check the batteries.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
You haven't said anything.
I didn't give you away the first time.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
Mona?
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
Oh, Cosmo!
He's in Palermo.
Why?
Yes. Do you want...
Seven years ago.
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
Me neither.
Oh my God.
I'm marrying your brother!
What?
Hi.
It's the best thing there is.
How can you ask me that?
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?
He's coming.
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
What about the wedding?
A week. Two weeks. No more.
He's my younger brother.
You have a brother?
How was your plane ride?
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
No.
And who's gonna pay for that?
Did he tell her?
Well. I don't really know where to start.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
What about the moon?
Did you see it?
We just come from the bank.
I know.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
Alright.
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
Don't fight.
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
You don't know where Loretta is?
I'm sure she did.
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
Can I get another one of these?
What happened?
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
You knew that man?
I guess you can't invite me in?
I'm a little cold.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
Where did you get the coconuts?
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
None shall pass.
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
Had enough?
Course I have.
Look!
Hello.
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
Now what happens?
Ni!
There!  Look!
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
What?
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
I'm thirty-seven.
I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...
Be quiet!
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
What is your name?
What is your quest?
'Ere.  He says he's not dead.
They cost fifty pounds each!
What - the curtains?
But, Father.
How?
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Yes ...  make sure ...
Why?
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
Oh!
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
Not bad, not bad.
How about yourself?
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
I've got my duties to attend to.
What's your name?
Yeah.
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
She's busy.
It is quite late enough.
And that is my last word on the matter.
I need a man who knows where I am.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
Too busy looking after themselves.
No loyalty.
She'll never understand it.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
Aye, ma'am.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
Yes.
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
Who?
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
Dear oh dear.
Where did you find it by the way?
What is he doing there?
Well?
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
Who told them that?
I have no idea.
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
How do you stop The Screamer?
How'd you know it was us?
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
Where do we go?
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
Alex...
You're not coming, Alex.
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
It's here!!!
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
Give her a chance, will you?
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
Cynthia...what's going on?
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
So, what did they say?
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
Get going. You don't want to be late.
Right. See ya.
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Yes?
Number 17.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
Okay.
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
I just wanted to come here.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
This Denny's.
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Yeah, they showed me
Could be unrelated.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
Why should we trust you ?
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
First Bank ? But how ?
You took an awful big risk back there.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
I'm not listening.
We drown.
So why this ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
Is this really the time ?
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
I work here, remember ?
Hey, try swimming. It works.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
Trust is earned not given away.
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
Well ?
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
What did you hear ?
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
What is Bruce doing ?
Will he make it out ?
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Good morning.
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
You had to remind me?
Don't mention it.
Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
Visualize a spare?
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
We have a baby?
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
And she saved it.
What can I do for you?
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
Change my name.
Boy, you're really into this.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
...I dropped it.
You mean,  this ring?
What do you think?
Right.
And you'd be my cousin?
It's not his fault!
Nick?
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
What's it for?
You're a good man Nicholas.
Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
I should do this myself.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Well maybe for you.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
It would be fantastic.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Wanna play?
Danny?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
What?
The boss is watching us...
I think it's still available.
Uhh, Miss devoto...
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
Stiffs??
Uh huh?
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
It's no big deal.
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
What's that?
Yeah.
No, why?
Here?
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
Goodnight Vada.
When?
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
Feeding my fish.
No sweetheart, you can't.
What??
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Hi, is Vada home?
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Thirty five dollars.
What do you get for that?
Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
We'd love to hear it.
Is that your camper?
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
What are they about?
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Where's Daddy?
How old are you?
Thomas J?
Uh huh.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
It'll bleed.
Where's your bike?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Sorry.
Pacifist!
I am running faster!!
Hi Vada.
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
So now you'll have a mother.
He likes her better than me.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
I dunno..
Close your eyes.
For what?
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
You think...
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
Impressive.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Zit cream?
I give.
I suppose it's too late to start over.
Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  But there it is, and he has to choose.
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
And the answer was so simple.
I've missed a step.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Endearingly absent-minded.
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
You never eat when you're despondent.
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Don't you throw up on boat?
Where did we first hear th...
I'm up against a deadline.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
... your one chance for true happiness?
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Almost three.
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
Is there food?
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
What did you say your name was?
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
You bet.
His Word.
What?
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
Bastard
You're kidding.
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Well, Mr. Green.
Hi, Sherry.
You want me to wait?
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Have you seen a woman about so high?
Parts.
Mom?
I feel really good.
I'm here.
I'd really like to see you.
Well...How have you been?
Wow!
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
I've got a gig tonight.
Stay.
I can't.
They said go see the chaplain.
I mean...
Do they have a show to give it to you?
No, we never did that
You do?
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
Ryan O'Neal.
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Oh, why thank you.
Which do you recommend?
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
You got something you want to do?
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
How is it?
Do you have a back up.
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
Do you miss Mallory?
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
That's indescribable.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
No fuckin' way!
Mickey, you're wasting time!
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
It's hard to say Capt'n.
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
How 'bout Mallory?
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
When do you want the assembly?
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Lose 'em.
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
Boy - you hear me?!
Want to talk to you.
What d'you think?
Where was that?
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.
And his age?
How 'you doin' man?
Oh yeah?
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
No. I'm new in town.
Went to college, huh?
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
Let's go, Duff.
What d'you mean?
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
How old is your boy?
Your boy.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
You still didn't answer my question.
My kids want me to teach them.
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
What about your boy?
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
Yeah!
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
Like a home, for one thing.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
Who're you?
That's right.
How are you?
I guess not.
Don't look like there's a right way.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
He's your son.
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
No. I only needed the code from you.
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
You're hurt...
Ghost a steppin' razor...
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
What's this?
Did you trace it?
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
Are you even really alive?
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
Want to fucking answer them?
I thought you already left.
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
What about before that?
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
I don't sleep much. You packed?
Yeah... fine.
What is it?
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
College?
You're Pam?
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
Senorita Josie.
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Hi!
Wings?
Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
A--flack jacket.
Uhh, no.
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Hey Rob, what's going on?
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
But now you don't have to--
Aloha! Welcome!
By name.
Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
Where are you going?
I told you I want that room unpacked.
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Oh, please...
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
You're fucked in the head.
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
You know her?
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
You want to talk about it?
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
Hi, guys.
All of them.
Did she always have nightmares?
I thought I'd wait for you.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
I thought I'd wait for you.
Girl, what are you doing?
Research.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
I gotta stay up, Max.
Nancy!
Max, where's Kristen?
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
That's what I know.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
Your dreams?
And what are they?
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
How do we get in?
A sad choice.
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
I won't allow it.
Why is he after us?
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
I forgot my bag.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Hi.
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
Why?
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
You like Chagall?
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
Who was Gilda?
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
Hello.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
Miracles do happen.
Di Caprio.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
No, no.  She doesn't.
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
Bad news.
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
Tell us about it...
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
Yes, ma'am...
Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
O-o-o-oh...
H-Hey, M-Mack.
H-H-Help!
God Bless America.
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
What?
Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
Giving up?
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
I refuse!
I'm the coach!
Hear what?
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Who told you that?
'Kay, place your bets.
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
I wanna see it...
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
Oh, what's that?
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
Oh, what was that?
Poker!
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
I don't, Doc...
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
'Kay, Mac!
'Kay, Mac!
'Kay!
What's troubling ya, buddy?
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
Hey, how ya doin'?
He's a patient, Rose...
He's in charge.
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
There they are!
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Now you talkin'.
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
I thought so.
You ol' fucker!
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
No, she wasn't my sister.
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
No.
Good.
Let's find a telephone.
...has a prior commitment.
We'll KNOW.
But, Faith--
Congratulations.
I'm in love with you.
He's safe.
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
He's out by the pool right now.
Right now?
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
What would you call it?
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
I was hoping for the real thing.
Beautiful place...
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
Scientologist.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
So?...
Yes you did.
What about your job?
I have vacation time coming to me.
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
What's that supposed to mean?...
You expecting somebody you know?
'Course he does.
That was a long time ago.
Because I'm the one who's single.
Why?
A little bad luck?
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
No.  No, you go ahead.
What if he doesn't like me?
And he is living proof.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
Yup.
Kate is that you?
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
It's siesta.
How old are you?
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
You miss me?...
Right.
I have to talk to her.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
Mania.
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that— he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it— main order of business?
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
What happened?  What happened?
I'm with Terry.
Everybody knew him. He got around.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in—
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
How would you've done it?
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
No thanks... .
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
You don't believe in anything, do you?
And if you don't?
You're not sore at me?
I— I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And— I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
I— I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
I don't rate it.
Edie— I— I— never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you— you're... .
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Terry, you're bleeding.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
He wanted to see me again.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
You still call it ratting?
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher— hooks— over 'n under—  — whop-whop!
Really?
You'll work.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Better.
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
No.
No advice. Just whiskey.
Terry?  What do you want?
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
I— I musta counted wrong, boss, I—
I— I was just on my way up, Johnny.
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
Go on, beat it!
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
What are you down here for— to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
Nothing is worth your life.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
You do?
Yes I feel it in my bones.
You're talking nonsense.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
A situation easily remedied.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
I will decide the conclusion.
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
The time...is short.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
Then why do you shake so?
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
He called the day he escaped.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
Let's go to Detroit.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
You tell your sister about it?
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
You know how I felt about her.
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
You ever wear one of these?
What?
We made it, didn't we?
Hello, Daniel.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Daniel.  Listen --
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
Put it down or I'll shoot.
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Why you think is today?
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Like being back in the yard, huh?
The fuck you talking about?
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
Faye Dunaway.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
Who was it answered the phone?
That's my dad.
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
How many?
Sounds high, doesn't it?
Really?
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
You goin' right back to work?
I'm not leaving Midge.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
Jesus, I don't believe it.
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
You're not?
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
You're a fighter?
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
What're you doing at Glades?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
No?
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
I didn't have time.
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
So?
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
Did you pay the guy the reward?
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
You mean hiding them?
Yes Sir.
Sir?
Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
They ready, Earl?
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
It's Germans!
Good shooting, Danny!
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
I got a half a tank.  You?
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Well sure, Colonel --
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
Oh, this is Betty.
Danny's not coming?
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
Fook ya!
Learn English, then!
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
The only one?
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
You drive like a maniac!
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
But what has to be different?
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
I've got to go now.
Come back to me.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
It was Beth's idea.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
Damn that Charlie I
I think they're going to deregulate it.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
What about?
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
What do you mean?
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
I'm just happy to see you.
But accidents can happen.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
What a great kite.
Sort of.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
What're you doing?
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
Give me some credit, will you?
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
What are you talking about?
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
What are you talking about?
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
You want me to help?
What in God's name... ?
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
This time. What about next time?
Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
Maybe you should think about it.
I'm ready...
About my blood work?
It's okay. Can I sit down?
One week old.
Congratulations.
Continue.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
One more thing, Your Honor...
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
What do you want?
Correct.
Charles. Okay. Miller?
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
Yes.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
Answer the question, please.
Hello?
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Duh...
Okay, Joe...
Not when I was in the Navy.
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
You came for us....
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
What do you see? Riddick?
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
Just come with me!
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
Let's wait on the power cells.
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
Dancin' on razor blades here...
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
How much you weigh, Johns?
This does not help us, Johns.
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
Why did I fall on you?
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
Some prophet guy?
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
Frightening thought.
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Said "looks clear."
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
As you wish.
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
No.
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
The evidence was very meager --
Yo!
No.
That way.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Hmph.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
Lucius.
Who put them up?
Read it yourself.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
How so?
No.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
Which one?
Do you believe him?
Bunker...
...but 'Lias is still out there.
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
Yeah. How 'bout you?
First time?
And you, do you believe?
Okay - got light duty, three days.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
I volunteered.
You volunteered for this shit man?
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
Found it. Growing in a garden.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
You wanted to see me sir?
The brush-off, huh?
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
How long would that take?
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
I see.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
I know it's a littler late for an apology.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
He got in here how?
They'll know whether he killed himself.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
Bad enough.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
They know you here--know your name.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
Why?
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
No percentage in that.
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
Mitchell was dead enough.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
Do you think I was faking?
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
What this?
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
Morning. Any calls?
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
The usual grind.
Hardly. Who's the girl?
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
A couple of hours.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
I don't think you locked your door.
Passkey?
He saw my face too.
Floater?
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
You get it's brother.
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
Who's the girl?
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
Nice.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
What's this?
How about your new friend?
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
Shall we go?
Now first of all, tell us your name.
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
Terrific.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Congratulations.  Who with?
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
Yes, please.
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
How nice.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
Not yet you know any of these people?
Let me see.
You're so gross.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Okay, I will.
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
Suez.  1956.
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
Yes.
What would you call it?
Promise?
Thanks for stepping in.
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
I gotta be fucking crazy.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
You gotta earn trust.
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
You're a fucking dead man--
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
They're on their way to Maui.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
I know where they're going.
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
Nice place.
Catch of the day.
What's goin' on?
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
My name's Johnny Utah!
Who cares!
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
Who's our back-up on this?
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
Mean anything to you?
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
There's something else, Major...
What's he got?
He knows our defenses.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
No.
You don't know anything about me.
I... I would take advantage of it.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
I never joke about money.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Try a strawberry.
Why?
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
Three.
Did you buy some clothes?
And that's the way the game is played.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Vivian...
I've never been on a plane before.
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
Did you?
I've never treated you like a whore.
What do you mean?
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
All this because of that whore!
Carlos had some great rock.
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
Dummy.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
Kit give me nothin'.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
I'm just going to my room.
You're a guest here?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
Vivian.
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
Excuse me?
Then I'm here till I die?
Every ship but the four you sent.
And what am I?
I fear I'll never see you again.
Can you move at all?
I will never doubt again.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
Probably he means no harm.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
The body?
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
-- well, when does it get good?
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
Shall we track them both?
Could this be a trap?
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
Sir. Sir.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
Do you always begin conversations this way?
There's something I ought to tell you.
Who are you?!
Go in, get after her!
Let me explain-
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
Australia.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
I'm not listening.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
Have fun storming the castle.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
I'll wait in the hall ...
Oooooooops!
But sir, I'm not condem ...
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
What is that?  A handkerchief?
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
But what if the play was a hit?
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Vaaaat???
Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.
We make love?
We can't play today?
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
By the sacred memory...
The Graf Spee...
Heil you know who!
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
Where are you going vit the light?
What have you done, LSD?
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
No.
How do you know she didn't make a call?
And when she left, she never came back.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
What's your interest?
Casharoonie!
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
A lot?
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
I was getting to that!
What thing?
I ought to call the police right now!
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
I feel better when you feel better.
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
He didn't come back here?
Where could he have gone?
Who's he?
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
Where'd you go to college?
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
What is it?
We could laze around here a while longer.
Can you?
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
I've caused you some trouble.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
You slept here all night?
Then I'm free to go...?
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Arbogast.
Went out before service.
I suppose you want a cabin.
I'll get your bags.
Satisfied with your cabin?
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
Do what?
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Yes.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Take me down there.
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
The wound is bleeding!
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
I won't let you say that!
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
You give me a pain!
And they never proved anything against him.
On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.
What!
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
Call the Homicide Squad!
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Do you know George Winton?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
Fine, thanks.
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
You're insane.
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
To lunch.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
Yep. Everything settled.
We flopped the first time out.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
But who were they?
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
Am I hurting you?
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
What are you going to do, Rose?
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Five hundred rabbits?
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
Of course not!
You were up late last night, Brother.
Open that door, damn you!
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
What'd you say, Brother?
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
Why is it taking so long?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Is her husband sick or something?
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
No, son, she is dead.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
Turn up your hearing aid.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
You're not having lunch?
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Who?
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
What have you got in your hair, girl?
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
Yes, I am.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
Well, no, I didn't actually.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
More history, Rose.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
Rose, you don't have to.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
Indivisible and inseparable.
Now you know what to watch for...
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
We should slow down.
No offices are gonna be open today.
That's them trying to kill us.
Name one.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
No.
Maybe.
You can't be serious.
Can't I?
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
Arriving tonight
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
Alright?
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
Come again... ?
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
Know what I love about dynamite?
You always did have style.
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Where am I?
Are you all right?
Fine. Together again, huh?
The same as always.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Leia!
Hey, are you awake?
What's going on?
I...
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
We're coming!
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
Oh!
What's he saying?
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Your father?
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
I know, father.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
There is no conflict.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
How many languages do you speak?
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
Yes.
Yes.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
I've got something to say.
I'm coming with you.
Oh....Say something.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
"Sweet Transvestite"
"Transylvania"
And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
...How's the turtle food this week?
I would say you're very shy by nature.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
Do you have a phone?
It's fine.
I don't think I belong here.
Would ya take off your glasses?
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
I thought it might be cute.
...Can't do it.
...I dunno.
Don't say that.
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
It's not your house --
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
What?!
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
You're hurtin', man!
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Of wa?
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
Why?
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
Yeah.
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
What?
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
Listen, I hope ya don't --
What was I gonna say?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
...Did ya fight last night?
Spider Rice.
'Bout an hour ago.
What's happened is freak luck.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
Yo, Benny.
Wanna keep goin'?
You were ready to bite that guy's face.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old!  She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
Help what?
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
I got whiskey here.
Gazzo's a good man.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
Is this paper even good?
Do you think the rabbit did it?
He's a riot.
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
So what's the scam, Eddie?
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
What's that comin' from the bar?
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
What a gasser.
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
Have you got the will?
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
A Toon?  Noooo.
Wrong number?
If I don't make it back here by ten...
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
By my head here come the Capulets.
Good-morrow, cousin.
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Farewell, my cuz.
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
What?
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Meaning, to court'sy.
Pink for flower.
I thought all for the best.
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
What?
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
So what's the deal?
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
Not to me, you know that.
Do I need to repeat myself?
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
I'd stake my reputation.
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
I sent it to myself in Paris.
How did you know?
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
You shoot alright.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
To see a man about a thing.
Something like that...
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
We live in a singular world, my friend.
He's going back.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
You sure your friend got the right place?
I never made that claim.
You were behind the door?
You would have done that?
How could you have done that?
What the fuck happened?
Right now?
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Just like that?
Why not?
Do you have a good answer?
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
Gone.  Destroyed.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Can you get it?
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Never heard of it.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Why?
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
That's not what I mean.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
And how do you figure we do that?
You're out of your mind.
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
Then we're screwed.
Oh Jesus...
It's too late...
It's NOT too late!
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
Just take it in stride.
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
No.  Why?
Has he?
What's wrong?
He's not, he's...
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
A satellite dish?
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Yeah, I've seen him.
What did he buy?
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
What?
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
What are you getting at?
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Don't you have to be here?
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
C?
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
You'd do this to me?!
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
Hi ma.
I didn't know you were coming.
How's work?
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
Did they ever find out who they were?
And what happened?
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
So someone did get away.
I'm not getting an answer.
Wait.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
No.  It's my first time.
Oh yes, she's very nice.
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
What's wrong?
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
He'll be back soon.
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
I wouldn't do that!!!
She saved our lives.
Shhh, my head hurts.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
Yes.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Baby Duck?
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
The police can protect you.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
Sir, I can explain.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
You speak English!
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
What?
That silly-ass look on your face.
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
Shortcut?
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
No, please, I don't --
What are you doing here?
Oh my god. Griffin.
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
You're killin' me here.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Yo, Johnson...
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
Yes.
Hello.
I will not have friends in America.
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
Yes.
What do you expect me to say to this?
And what did you say?
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
Of course.
We do it to our dog.
"Nothing but net."
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
You're coming here?
I have no idea what I'm doing.
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
They made me put my hat back on.
Getting nervous?
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
Everest.  Is that right?
Give me that!
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
Seven-fifty.
I'm a work in progress.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
You don't know.
I'll have the same.
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
Can you fix it?
Brian told you that?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
I'd rather not.
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Lighten up, wahine.
Let's go.
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --
Nope.
I'll wait.
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
So what happened?
At the top of the Empire State Building --
What was that about up there?
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
Turn on your radio!
Becky?
I love that dream.
Becky?
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Yes, I did.
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
No.
What's tira misu?
You'll like it.
It's Y. O. H.
Yeah.  What's that?
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
Window.
Do you want a fruit plate?
It plays in 50 states.
Does red pepper go under R or P?
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
Somewhere in the middle.
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
Is that what she used to sing?
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Jonah!
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
Have you seen my wallet?
What's wrong with Annie?
Did not.
Did too.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
No.
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
What about camping?
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
You're welcome to one.
How's it going?
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
You want 'em all arrested?
No, Estellita.
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
This water's cold again.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
No.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
Ramón were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Go on. Spill it.
No ...
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
That's it?
Yeah.
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
Leave me out of this.
Then leave.
Oh. Hi.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
What is it?
Colette, go.
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
What time is it?
I know a guy.
Sorry.
Don't get carried away.
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Yes, Jimmy.
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
No, I'm good.
Not bad.
You're serious?
Anything for a dear friend.
If you say so.
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
You think I'm a Judas?
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
What the hell are you doing here?
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
This chink have a name?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
Bullshit. He's a liar.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
That's because he doesn't have one.
Please ... don't do this ...
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Excuse me?
You mean like the Donner Party?
My sentiments exactly.
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
So, where are you from?
As a matter of fact, I am.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
Yes, sir.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
We left them eighty-eights.
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
Senator's son?
Upham?
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
What about our grenades?
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
Beasley's dead.
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
How about I go right, sir?
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
Uh, oh.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Huh?
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
I'd like to go, sir.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
Because he's guilty.
No, no he's not.
This evening is over.
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
No, no, don't go in there.
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
Lloyd, give it up.
Yes.
No, you're not a guy.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Meaning?
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
Confirm this with my office and my client.
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
I'm fine.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
You're going.
You're not listening to me.
Dad, are you okay in there?
Honey!
What am I supposed to think?
You think you know what this money is?
This is me telling you about me.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
I'll go.
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
Keymaster?
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Basic.  Hmmm.
Today is tomorrow.
Yeah?
I think you should wear that.
Stop by later.
Okay, bye.
No.
Yeah.
Well, I need to study, and...
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
It sounded like you did.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
Then don't do it.
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
Hello Lloyd.
Are you?
No way.
What?
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
I don't know.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Well, let's find him.
What's your name?
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
What -
In Breslau.
We started without you.
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
You asked for shoe polish.
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
That's great.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
That's great, thanks.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
Better this month than last?
What?
I'll talk to him.
Eight hundred, give or take.
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
How's the name search going?
Have you checked the...
You're sure about this two person thing?
What is it?
That's okay.
I'm inquisitive.
You could start with an apology.
It helped me realize one thing.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Jesus, you’re just as whacked as your son.
You’re the one who got away.
We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It’s been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Who is this?
You're getting obvious.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
I got a surprise for you.
Who is that guy?
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
What's your favorite scary movie?
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
I get scared really easy, okay.
There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
Melinda McGraw?
Who is this?
What?!
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
Please, call me Gale.
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!
Are you sure?
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
Oh yeah, how?
Is that a threat, Detective?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
What?
I can see nothing's changed.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Stop following me.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Basements creep me out.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
What?  What movie?
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Duh... that's quick.
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
Close call.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
Or even a good porno.
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
Yes.
Hello.
Hello.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Why do you want to know my name?
I'm getting scared.
I believe you...
How do you know his name?
That all depends on you.
No... please.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Come on, yes you do.
You tricked me...
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
So is Dewey your real name?
Does mom know?
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
At the airport.
You girls ready.
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
How's the book?
Have you talked to Cotton?
And why would she do that?
Where do you get this shit?
Are you alone in the house?
Uh-huh.
Working, thank you.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Don't come any closer.
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
There goes my chance with Sid.
I'm not worried.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
What am I? The beer wench?
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
Murderers like you?
Not here.
Drop it.
You go to movies at least?
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
So they ran our list.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
Think about it...
What are you talking about?
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
He's preaching.
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
What?
How long have you lived here?
I don't know, with this case.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
Perfect example.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Did their son see it happen?
How's California?
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
You fit a lot of descriptions.
I didn't give any order to fire!
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
Unnt-meah!
I've come now...
Ay-eh...They was here...
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
Talk!
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
Say it. We're beat!
Hey! What's the idea...?
Oh...
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
Why didn't he make his move back there?
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
Well I ain't one of 'em!
Might at least have left me my pants!
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
It wasn't much of a letter...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
She'd be about thirteen now...
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
She was old.
Maybe an animal.
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
What?
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
You did not like the speech?
Oh…what have I done?
Thank you, my lady!
What do you want, Kit?
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Wait!  Will you desist!
Never!
You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
When?
Of course not!
What happened to Sam?
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
Your mother, and your father
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
"Madam!"
I am, Master Shakespeare.
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
Like you, I found him not at home!
I have, Master Shakespeare.
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
Even your play.
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
Will you read it for me?
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
My lord.
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
I . . .
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
A man, my lord?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
I'm only asking what you think.
No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
No.
You mean immoral.
A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
I just thought we should discuss it.
I don't know.
Doesn't it worry you?
Looking for you? Yes.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
So I gathered.
Where do you think you'll go?
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
Well?
This is just an informal discussion.
It looks like he's writing everything down.
No. Why should it?
I don't know them.
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
David?
Hugo.
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
Be careful.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
He can't stay up there.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
What?
It's about the burglary.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Two?
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
I've never seen a dead body before.
I thought you'd gone to work.
In this firm.
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Eh --
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
What happened to that guy?
That one, last week.
A priest who dies.
I write about it?
October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.
That sounds fine.
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
Sorry?
You can tell by the intonation.
You're in a good mood today, George.
Chicken salad.
Who?
Yes, but... I thought...
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
Thanks a lot.
She's got a...
I'll be back in a while.
I gotta talk to you.
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
No.
Are you?
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
You think that's funny, don't you?
I am not!
Right now?
And you need money?
George!
Yeah.
You promised you'd do the show.
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
-- Well no. It never came up.
You going to tell him?
You would?
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
-- don't you want to --
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
-- very nice, very nice.
-- yes, you --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
Wanda...
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Fine. How are you?
Honey, what happened?
I am?
Will we live together?
Okay...  Night, baby.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Yeah.
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
Going where?
Now, Jackie --
Yes.
-- no, it'll help me, really --
... well I'm glad you told me.
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
George, now cut this out.
Did you?
George...
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
It's good you want to do something, George.
When?
Tonight?
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
Well anyway...
Was it me, did you have something against me?
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
No thanks.
She's nothing but a whore.
No --
No.
I was too old.
Sid.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Shut the door, shut the door!
They get hair all over the place.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
Who is that?
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
-- No. No really.
It must be something.
Didn't you have any panties on?
-- He reached up and tore them.
Is he an enemy?
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
-- what's the problem, honey?
Are you having a good time?
Chocolate.
Who's Tony?
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
What about Room 237?
Yeah.
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
Mommy!
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Please...
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
I did?
No charge?
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Perfect for a child.
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
What do you want me to do about it?
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
He's still asleep.
Why?
Stop it!
Wendy give me the bat.
Wendy...
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
Hi.
Eight thirty.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Sure, Uncle Al.
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
What's the money for?
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
What's that?
There's something else scary.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
Yeah.
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
Sure.
Yeah... sure.
You want to know what I think?
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
Yeah? Really?
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
What about crack?  You a user?
You know what we're saying!
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
Vince...
This prom is a real drag.
Oh-huh.
What is it, Betty?
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
HE'S SO FINE.
Not in years.
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
What is it, Mary?
Hurry, Sister!
I knew that.
What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
You were unhappy?
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
Are you talking about me?
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
A what?
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
You sent for me?
I must go where I can be of use.
What are you doing here?
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
You saved my life.
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
What'd she say?
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
I've got to go.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Who are you guys?
A nun?
I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
Peace on Earth.
It's better than ice cream.
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
... Brom Bones...
Protest to my superiors if you like.
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
He drowned.  Anyone could see.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
Lady Van Tassel...
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
My suitor?
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
I insist that you have it.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
My God... what has happened?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
I don't reckon.
Yeah, they's good all right.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
Thank ye.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
Please Doyle, don't.
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
Leave.
Don't tell me what to do.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
It went real good.
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
I want to watch T.V.
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.
Don't hit that boy no more.
What numbers do you punch?
Yeah.
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?
They still around, your folks?
How do you know?
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
Yeah, I did.
Were they bad people?
Maybe they needed it.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
Naw.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
A little ol' boy.
You threw it in a trash barrel?
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
It was fun, anyhow.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
You know I would. Whatever you want.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
Did Vaughan go home?
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
Mama?
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
Yeah.
I'll be.
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
I done et just a little bit ago.
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Like me, too.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
It's yours?
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
Two, right?
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
Ready. Any time you are.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
For keeps.
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
Lovely.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Thomas.
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
Well what?
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
Huh?
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
That's it. Just the two rooms.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
Ah, coffee. Smells good.
Thanks. 
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
And started to run.
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
Hi, kid.
Lettuce and tomato?
None.
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
Happy for him.  And relieved.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
You don't believe in God anymore.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
How long you have this detail?
You mean, early morning the 16th?
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
You said three minutes.
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
You think so?
Naw, I had that around for a while.
What makes you think I play?
White or black?
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
I believe so.
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Can I say something, here?
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
I'll say.
You're right, Joe.
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
I told you - it's a sure thing.
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
Done what?
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Men?
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
Good night, Daphne.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
You know - the old shell game.
What are you doing with my flowers?
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
Like what?
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Oh.
Not that, you idiot.
Sugar?
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
What'll I tell him?
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
Anything wrong?
I'm not that sick.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
We better have a drink first.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
Josephine -
I guess she's not in here.
I hope so.
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
We could pass for that.
Just a moment, miss -  May I?
If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
Why?
This is where I get off.
About that roadhouse -
You're leading again.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
This is her roommate.  Daphne can't talk right now.  Is it anything urgent?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
Have you ever been with a male band?
Yeah.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
What makes you so sure?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
Shell Oil?
Would you mind moving along, please?
What?
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
Oh - in here.
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
What else is there for me? 
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
I think you're on the right track.
Good morning.
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
I know.  Every time!
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
Go where?
I never join nothin'.
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Don’t worry about it.
I should get going.
Hey.
Fred Astaire and what’s her face!
You know all that “if these walls could talk” stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
Where’s Nick sleeping?
I’m sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
She did?
Um, just about everyone.
You heading to the train station?
Ah, a philosopher.
Shrink, actually.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
That was a long time ago.
I’m sorry?
Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
And you thought I’d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
What?!
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It’s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you’re not walking away!
When I said I’d never done a wedding before, I didn’t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
I should go.
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. You’re here for the highland flings, I bet.
Hi, kiddo.
That’s not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
I’m worried. Amy’s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it ‘drunker’ or ‘drunker-er’?
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
Sometime, but not like this.
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
I did look, Charlie, but I--
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
Yes, sir...
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
Sunday...
Miss Boatwright --
David!
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
Did you see Daddy?
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
Whatcha got there?
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
Little chilly.
But, Nathan--
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
Fuckin' a right.
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
Who the hell made up that law?!
I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.
YOU DO?!
Mph rm rmph!!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
You've got a stupid accent too.
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
What's going on, Chef?
Hello there, children!!
Mrph?
Dude, we don't have watches.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Be careful, dude.
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
I don't know, dude.
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
I thought you had something planned.
Stan!
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
Huh?
And Bill?
How is the children's progress?
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
What's the matter, Wendy?
My friend the clitoris told me.
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
Why, didn't they say?
You want to go back to shuttle work?
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
I think I can handle it.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
That's right.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
So what's going to happen to you?
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Sooner than later.
We have room!  Let's go!
So close...
Carlo!
I'm going back for Taylor!
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
Heh, heh, heh.
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
I hate fuckin' opera.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
It's mine.
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
What about bowling?
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
He's the guy Buzz.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
How Mr. Kastle?
Where's Junior?
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
What do you want with my dad?
Won't your father help you with that?
This is a vicious cycle.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
What does he do?
No. Do You?
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
More than you could afford.
You're here.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
You told Junior that we did it.
How do you get this thing down?
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
Very professional.
I am a professional man.
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
You guys got something going on downstairs?
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
Yeah.  I heard you.
Storm?  What storm?
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
-- Wait a second --
-- dating the crash at least that old.
They pressurize us with helium.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
Wait a second --
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
You don't think weapons are important?
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
Well, where the fuck is he?
They've left, keep watching!
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
You don't know that.
What?
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
A half a mile long?
What's wrong?
We had considered it.
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
I love secrets.
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
The library.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
In Edmunds' things.
What?
Beth --
You, me and Harry?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
The refridgerator.
We must've had it delivered then.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
Valdomet.
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
P-a-r-a-s-o...
How long does it last?
You want to kill him?
You ever given an injection before.
Not believing you.
Where are you?
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
How do you feel about snakes?
You know what I mean.
Do you fear them?
Are you manifesting them?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
You're lying --
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
Beth, stop it!
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
Well, what's your theory?
Then what is it?
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
Fine.  I'm fine.
C'mon.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Norman, where are you?
But why would she -- ?
Wisconsin?
I can't reach her.
Well, press something!
Nine hundred feet to surface.
There is one possibility.
You mean forget?
Meaning?
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
Beth and Harry?
You mean they haven't told you yet?
You've heard of me?
What report?
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
What kind of a crash was it?
I don't know.
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
No, not anymore.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
Good morning!
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
Are you all right?
Are you sure you don't need it?
What is it?
You mean we should go after her!...
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
Have you been checked out?
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
I'll make a report later.
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
Who's the pilot?
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
I found it... It's just not there.
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
We'll send a squad up.
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Mobile Infantery rules !
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
I'm all ears.
Or...?
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
What ?
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
No thanks, Diz.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
What ?
All bands.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.
All dead except one, sir.
Sergeant, secure the boat !
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
Programming ready?
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
What answers?
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Then you'll be wet.
I'll be there.
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
I...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
I understand...
Mmm.
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
Hello.
Cast stood me up.
What are you doing down there?
Gonna' be good as new.
Hi.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You believe that?
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
...yes.
Where you going?
No, that's true.
That's something a man could do...?
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
What are you going to do?
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
We on for tomorrow night?
Drama Group?
And I might have something important to tell you...
What, what what are you doing here?
Yes, that's right.
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Courthouse back in town.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
They think it's your First Wife...
She wasn't in the...
Bobby, don't say anything.
Aren't you ever in school?
Izzat so?
I think he's moved...
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
I wasn't in the car.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
She's absolutely r...
Look.
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
...wants a piece...
I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
I know...
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
Doug, the traffic light...
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
How about that.
Mmmm.  You have children?
Who's White...?
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
I don't drink.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
I...
I didn't say anything to them.
I don't...
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
I left that for you.
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
How was your flight?
<u>Pay</u> her.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
Do something.
And we're glad to have you here...
She coulda done better than him.
Bet you did.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
I'm gonna call him.
Well, not exactly s...
Scream.
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
Not with my mouth open.
I'm not.
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.
What if he's kidnapped?
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
Help me here...
But Rache...
...your hating me.
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
That I do.  Always will.
You have the WORST flu since...
Where Ben?
Find the bird cage?
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
And when did that pass?
That's necessary, huh?
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
Which part of no don't you understand?
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
We're not discussing your age.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
Still, please.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
We...
WE are over.
We're going to win this.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
Get out!
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
I don't, but...
See, I know that.
Small world.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
Rache, it may take time.
She's not gonna die.
No problem.
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
Maybe he's gay.
What?
Oh.
No prob. I'm cool.
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Four brothers and five sisters.
I did not go to high school.
We had to work. My family was poor.
I'm still poor.
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
Consuelo. Are you crying?
How did they execute him?
But really, you never know.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening…
We're not ready.
Twinkeys!
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
Is everything OK?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
Oh. What happens now?
You're tired of me. I can tell.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
Yeah?
OK.
One in a million recover.
Hey, Mikey!
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Say, Ni...
Ni...
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Who is this?
Oh, fine. How are you?
So what's going on?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Oh, I don't remember that...
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
Forget about it.
What do you mean?
Cooper...
What are you talking about?
Where does it lead?
What about Cooper--where is he?
She's as good as gone...
Who's Ryan Cooper?
What!
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
I say we head out.
If I don't get power up we are!
We can't--it's power driven!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
I have your word, Mister President?
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
What kind of trouble?
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
Yes?
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Do you recognize my voice?
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
I see.
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
Go on, Major.
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
I presume the planes are armed?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
What else could it be?
War.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Second safety.
How do you know he's dead?
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
What do you mean?
Why should they call us back?
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
Who's that?
I'm okay.  What's up?
But I get a red light.
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
I asked you a question, Lothar!
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
I don't anymore.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Typical male.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Your a nurse?
Now?
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
It's your birthday?
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
You know what we should do? Go to the...
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No, no.
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
Buff...
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Really?
So, how was the ride, kids?
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
You better! Yes!
He paid you man.
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
It's okay.
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
Okay.
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
Hi.
I'd like to.
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
Deep down. Way down.
Yeah?
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Oh, wow.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
I'd love to read that.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Sooze wants to see him.
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
That chick, Erica?
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
This is my home.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
No.
Jeff, stay there.
Why we're just standing here.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
God, I haven't seen you all day.
I hate that.
Man?
Of course I do!
This is ridiculous!
Us.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
No, no.
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
Come on.
Mm-hm.
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
What?
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
I hope you're happy!
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Look at you!
Like?
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Yeah, come on, play it.
Alright, alright already.
Soon.
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
You do?
Whatever.
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
I'm going out later.
I'm in, too.
Spit from your dad?
Jack, I think I should get a job.
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.
Hello?
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
You got that big retarded girl down there?
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
Uh...maybe?
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
If I could be of any help...
I was afraid of that.
What about all those ideas you had?
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
So do I.
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
May I say you smell real special.
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
I don't want it now.
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
What's the matter, Norma?
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
Well?
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
I don't know.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
You'll like it here.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
I need some money right now.
I don't need a tuxedo.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
What right do you have to take me for granted?
Go away.
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
I ran into some people I knew.
Where are my cigarettes?
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
I think I'll read a little.
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
Is that so!
Some men are here.  They asked for you.
What doctor?
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
You made her a star?
Joseph C. Gillis?
We've come for the car.
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
What's that?
Let me kiss you.
No.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
Just like that?
But why?
It seemed that way to me.
Miss what?
Are you asking me for a "date"?
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
They think I have a concussion.
And you think you're in love.
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
You vicious--
Why the empty cage?
Why George, are you proposing?
Theories?
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
He's nice.
No, MR. Danvers.
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
A cheap trick.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
Yeah? What do you want?
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
You know what's the problem?
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Sure.
Say!
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
Mmmmm . . .
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
First paycheck?
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
Columbia.
What?
Just the man I wanted to see!
Uh...what channel were you watching?
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
They ain't got captains?
Is this blackmail?
Yeah? How's it look?
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
But the other night...
Oh, Superman!
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Yes! This time we got it right!
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
Maybe you wanted to.
We'd better talk.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
I'll try to remember that . . .
Does Lois know about this yet?
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
This way Lex.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
My kind of people.
DELETE IN CUTTING
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
Who is this . . . Superman?
Free!
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..

This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
Yes?
They make my eyes itch.
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
Oh . . . my . . .
Gee, I'm really sorry.
I'm not so sure you do.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
Impossible? Why?
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
I think he's kind of cute.
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
What I need this for?
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
What'd you call him?
Screaming
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
Again???
I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
I read the article.
Meteorites!
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
I mean the other one!
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
Then -
What're you writing, Lois?
Boy!
What's your name, boy?
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
How good it felt!
There are none of them any good anyway.
He is. Usually.
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
You think they're strange?
Can you really see through anything?
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Sure.
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
Is that real enough for you?
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
And what does he do again?
Which clinic?
What happened?
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
I will.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
Why are you telling me this?
Are you sure?
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
C'mon, you know that won't...
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
Have you been waiting long?
Good night, Billy.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
Why?
From what?
You talked about it?
Why would he be frightened?
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
Isn't it a lovely day?
From you?
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
So he was mean?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
Why?
I have no questions.
She...she was a friend of mine.
What do you mean?
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
Here we go.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
That's not news, Zoe.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
What for?
No.
Who did they get for that?
You think someone else caused the accident?
Any criminal record?
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
Yes.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
You mean it?
Nothing.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Why, has he bothered you before?
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
Not being partial, are you?
Sidney is a liar!
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Not "we", Sidney, you!
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
He means that much to you...?
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
Talk to her, Sidney...
Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
What would you think of me if -
That's the third time he's called today.
He wants me to break a leg?
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Yes, but why?
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months -
No more you don't!  What is this - You're showing off for her?  They're supposed to hear you in Korea?
Steve, I...
Please... let... the kids... go...
Those lying motherfuckers!
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
That is one of my mission parameters.
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
So she's pretty cool, huh?
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
Why attack Russia?
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
And no elbows on the table!
You have a question for Helmuth, David?
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
Not yet.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
No. Ours was damaged.
I can't do this. It's not right.
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
Steve Arnold...
I was warned.
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
Then you are wrong.
You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
What?
Stop this, please, stop this now!
Of course I know what that is.
Okay, so what is it?
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Major.
Show you?
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwängler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
First oboe.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Yes, Chuck?
You can't to that...
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
What's it to ya?
You must have a girlfriend.
Do you understand?
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
And you're from the future too?
I caught one, back there.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
That's where we're going.
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
I want it to be over for you.
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
That stuff's two hours cold.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
Do you know what to do?
This is nuts.
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
Don't even think about it.
Why not?
If there was one.
I'll give you a boost.
You first.
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Get out of my car!
Who are "they?"
What?
... what... ?
Nicholas...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Really?
Trust me.  Call that number.
But, will you?
I'm going to call.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
What are you doing?
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
Really?
Yeah.
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
Robbed?
I'll explain someday.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Ilsa... you're alright?
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
I don't like her.

What?
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
It's not going to hold your weight.
You're not telling us something.
I didn't do it.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
All the carvings.
Sorry.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
I don't know.
Why would we want to do that, Nell?
Is she asleep?
Oh God, we can't get out!
Why'd she kill herself?
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
David.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
We all did.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
We think?
There's been some trouble downtown.
What kind?
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
Oh really?  Where you from?
Eduardo.  Rama.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Who done it, then?
This ain't your lot?
Did Jenny know?
You're kiddin' me, right?
And that's where you met Jenny.
What are we standing on?
Again?
Probably.
Not her brand.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Here, are you always this sarky?
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
-- Your employer?
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
I guess you're just habitual.
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
How do you know?
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
And that is?
A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
Walked.
Who's looking for you?
I don't.
Thanks.  You, too.
Yes, Ann?
Hello, Rachel.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
Oh, Mr Crane--
Look, I'm no expert, but--
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
...Uh-huh.
Ah... it's nothing.
I don't understand.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
And how do we share--
Maybe.
It's OK.
She's a rare one.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
...Huh?
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
Dave.
I took Doris's keys.
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
...who among us is in a position to say...
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
...You ever wonder about it?
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
You don't got a headache?
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
That's very generous.
...We goin'?
I don't understand.
Crane. Ed Crane.
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
Not an owner.
Homicide.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
I'll go down and speak to him.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
Hurry up!
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
I think I should come with you.
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
What is it?
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
What is it?
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Quiet!
What is it?
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
They've got something.
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
I don't understand.
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
What is it doing?
I think... it means it's full.
Then it won't go after the others?
Just like John.  He won't listen.
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
Where exactly?
Close up?
What happened down there?
Why would we--
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
That and a fat, new contract.
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
Nothing was real.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
What's he doing?
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
That's right.  Lauren.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
I've got to talk to you.
Who?
It'd be an adventure.
What're you doing down here?
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
You hate gambling.
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
Well, I made it through another night.
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.
They're coming.  Any minute.
I don't understand.
Well, we're FBI agents.
What am I doing here?
What is it you find incredible?
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
Not according to the men in blue.
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
What do you think?
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
You told me you had answers.
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
You've been using me --
Mulder -- it's me --
Where are you, Scully?
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
Jesus, Mulder...
Why?
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
I don't know.
How was it contracted?
What?
This virus -- it... 
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
Been where?
What? What's wrong?
I have. I did. It's done.
Scully --
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
Agent Mulder --
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
A virus?
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
No.
Yes mother.
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
Where the hell are we?
I heard Julia and John got married.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
Dr. Kent.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
What else do we do?!
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
Give her some cigarettes.
He was Harry's driver?
Anything really wrong with your papers?
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Oh, that was many years ago.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
We're both in it, Harry.
What's the matter?
I wish I knew.
I'm going back home.
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
Are you going, too?
Joseph Harbin...
He works in a military hospital.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
They are - private - letters.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
Can you tell me whose...
My name is Calloway.
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
I can't say that I have.
Him dying like that.
Get the next plane.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...
All right, Calloway. You win.
I said you win.
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
No, a major, were you really?
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
Hello, Harry.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Dr. Winkel?
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Kurtz.
Yes, it is.
Harry...
Okay.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
So how many miles do you think it is?
What about Moliere?
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
But he has been there, off course.
Hi.
Have you told someone?
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
So?
They only kill them when they love them?
What, do you like it here?
Oh, please...
What do you care?
I don't, but...
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Too difficult?
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
Disease? What disease?
Where'd you read all that stuff?
Why no silencer?
Is he a Nazi?
Oh, really?
I'm coming to your room tonight.
How come there's no punctuation?
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
What assholes.
With you there's a tragic dimension.
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
And belief follows?
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
How would you kill him?
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
I don't know. Is that right?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
I can't say that.
That's meat.
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
Tell it to Hitler.
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
Get out of here....
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
You remember Miriam....
How did you know they were Jews?
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
Where do you think you're going?
We tested the new bomb.
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
What do you mean?
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
What kind?
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
What was he like, when he was little?
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
The Mamma's there too.
He can learn.  He is learning.
Don't.
Why?
Enzo, wake up!
Plenty of women everywhere right?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
It isn't lit yet.
... What's your name again?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
Great!
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
... Everything.
Why?
Yes.
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
You look adorable.
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
Jacques, you set a world record.
So have I.  ... Hello?
I didn't dive.
What are you doing?
Jacques...?
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
Anything.
Where are you from, Henrietta?
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
In my apartment?
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
You called the police?
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
Wait!  Professor...?
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
Get off of me you cripple!
My son—in—law. What do you think of him?
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
Then what do you do?
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
They don't say it to me.
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
What, senorita?
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Why?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
To the eye? Like other men.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
No.
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
I thought they came right past here ——
Why?
That's a fact, isn't it?
No —- not yet.
Get it out of here!
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
No —— not yet.
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
What! You can't be --
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -— where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Why’s that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess there’s space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
That’s right.
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people don’t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They’re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
Have you got a pen?
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you can’t satisfy him?
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish you’d use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what you’re owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
How... When did you...
My brother hung himself.
Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Simplify and damn.
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
The staff don’t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn’t take any more...
Why the hell couldn’t you divorce the man?
Yes. I’m trying to reach a friend but I can’t get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
A recent acquisition. We’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat’s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we’re doing here?
How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Thank you. But I think I’ll go to bed. It’s been a long day.
Get a pen and don’t ask any questions.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
What...?
Friedman’s dead... They killed him...
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
Hi...
Emily...
Why?
Yeah.
Who are you?
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
What kids?
Should I?
I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
It’s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Carlos De Moraes?
Didn’t you say I came recommended?  That’s what I thought. May I know by whom?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
What happens now?
Where is Friedman?
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
Evening. Table for one?
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
A private investigator... You’re not Austrian?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
Do you know Leon’s parents names?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
I take it you don’t know where he is, then?
A l’achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C’est pas vraiment mon truc.  I don’t know any Austrian, Xavier.
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
Okay, shitbag. I’m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
I think you’d rather not know what I think.
They lost their son. Why?
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Mossad?
Cost what?
What do you think?
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Now?
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
I don't know it.  I feel it.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
W-w-what are you doing?!
Arrest them!
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
No no, I'm fine, really...
Really?
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
You will??
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
You did well...
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
I know...
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
What's going on?
Not yet.
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
Yes.  We can pray.
But the bridge has been pulled down!
Clear?
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Do you know how to count?
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
I... submit to Our Lord.
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
Stop it!  What are you doing?
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Who gave you that horse?
No.
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
What are you doing out here?
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
Do you think this cross will protect you?
Him?
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
I'm on the run!
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
But I want to help, I want to.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Bitch!
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
What's happening?
Baines is packing up?
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
Play a gig.
You the owner here?
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
Then why ain't he dead?
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
They're still looking for him.
Hackers.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
He's waitin' for you in the card room.
What do ya mean?
He threatened to kill me.
Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
See ya and raise three.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You doin' anything tonight?
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
And you were gonna pay me back?
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
Don't think I know him.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Come on, gimme a break.
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
Nothing.
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
You've got to get your mind off this.
What are you talking about?
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
He's waiting for you.
How's your brother?
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
How'd you people happen to pop in?
Not without a warrant.
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
No.
Trail him!  Trail who?
There are a few things we want to check up on.
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
You did!
I think we may as well sit down.
Chris!
What are you going to do?
Why, you said...
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
You're going to return every cent of it!
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
What do you think?
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Where's Gilbert?
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
You did... where?
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
Why tell me?
So it's you he was after!
Six Martinis.
She didn't tell me a thing.
Good. I want to talk to you.
No thanks.
But it's Christmas now.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
Sit down!
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
Not with all your money!
Sure I will.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
What things made you so sure?
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
I hope you're well.
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
Nick Charles here?
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
What?
Oh, God!  Oh God!
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
You're not losing trust, are you?
If they land--
He's not going to leave us.
Wes might be right about that.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
No.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
You still got a map on you?
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
Don't you touch it.
An Iraqi?
Can you ride a horse?
When did you make the switch?
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
You get it yet?
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
How long we going to keep this up.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
You down?
Maybe we should give him some water.
You're going to burn up in those.
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
Now?
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
Then why did you bring it up?
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
What time is it?
No!  Don't go.
What's going on....what are you doing?
We're leaving.
We're leaving.
Who?  Who's leaving?
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
I've got it!  Astounding!
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
I'll report you.  It's....
...it doesn't matter.  The rest of it just didn't happen.
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
I don't know.
Remember this...?
Just look at all those people.
....with me?  What am I to her or she to me?  Nothing.  She's an ordinary roommate.  I..I share...
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Yep.
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
Yeah, another round thing.
I don't know.
What do you think?
Right.
Whadaya mean?
You got it.
Alright!
What's the matter?
Stay here.
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
Next week we work the park.
A what?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
I promised her she'd be safe.
It's our only option.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
Yes.
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
What did you talk about?
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
You're looking fine, Major.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
He's really not a bad fellow.
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
I want to see-- 
Yes, Baron?
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
Monescu.
Who?
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
Gaston Monescu.
Last year? It can't be that long.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
The fourteenth of May.
Two fifty-three, five--
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody.  Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Certainly!
Éysée seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Yes.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Well--I am Madame Colet.
Naturally I did.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
What?
This used to be my secretary's room.
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
Yes, I would!
I <u>must</u> go.
Ah, let me have a little fun.
I don't believe it!
Goodbye...
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
Then why did you do it?
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
A hundred and one next month.
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
None of the stewards have seen her.
What could possible be funny?
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Cor... look at that, would ya.
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
No.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
Could it have damaged the ship?
It's bad.
I'll be right back.
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
April 14, 1912.
Is your stateroom alright?
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Will you leave me alone?
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
You're coming back--
Nice lines--
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
You're not very ambitious, are you?
Married?
Yes?
But I'll have cocktails with you.
But--
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Sally--!
Who with?
Not here--follow me around the shed.
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
You take some awful chances.
Thank you, sir. 
I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
How's your mother feeling?
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
Here's your fifty.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
In New York.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
Knots!
Hello, Denby!
I thought I put you to bed.
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
Like it?
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
What's he got that I haven't got?
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
About twelve hundred.
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
I'll explain later--
Nothin'.
Let me look at it.
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
Come on, you...
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
Forget it.
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
Doc!  How the hell are you?
Since when is faro a business?
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
But Doc-
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
A which?
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
Fun though, wasn't it?
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
Always?
You feel bad about this?  About me?
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?
Yeah?
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
Look pretty rough.
Well we're off and running.  Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.
Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
Sir Elliot.
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
I'm sorry.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
I appreciate your time -
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
Is this another one of your games?
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Married?
Happily.
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Bourbon. Neat.
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
If I were you -
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
He was my father's best friend!
What the hell does that do?
Are you listening to me?
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
Take the men. I can finish alone.
Is the helicopter ready?
Fueled and waiting.
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Maybe. Maybe not.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
It is just a regular card.
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
No, I'm too hot now.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
You invited me.
How many people do you all feed?
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
What are you doing?
Where is Skip?
He is in his pigeon cage.
Whadda ya think?
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
To infinity and beyond!
Right here in the van.
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
T-O-Y.  Toy.
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Shhhhhhh!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Hi!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
B-3.
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Hey!!
That ain't no happy child.
Laser-envy.
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Reach for the sky!!
Bad news?!
Is there anything else I should know about him?
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
I finished it off.
Did you now.
So did I.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
I can't find Manolo.
What?  What is it?
Why are you talking like that?
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
Helena --
Why?
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
So's the video camera.
Where are you going?
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Caroline --
Hi.
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Helena --
What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
How are your grades?
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling?
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.
No --
Not Tiger Woods.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
One question.  How did you find about this?
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
I got money.
I don't know what to say.
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
Who do we interface with on their side?
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
Did you tell him?
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
Well, I've not brought them.
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
Jesus.
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
No, not holding hands.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
Oh, really?
Clear?
Good luck, Spud.
Yeah.
But try too hard --
You Only Live Twice?
The park?
Who wrote it?
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
What do you mean?
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
What about The Untouchables?
Despite the Academy award?
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
Well, it's up to you.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
Went ballistic?
What?
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
No, no, it's not possible.
Sulu, what are you doing?
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
Bob?
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
No, but you can bet they will.
Join my quest.
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
What are you doing?
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
I could use a shower.
But he does seem familiar?
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
Yes, Captain?
You must allow us to act.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
Is it possible?
Is what possible?
Spock?
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
What makes you think I won't turn us around?

Borgus Frat.
They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
Sybok, we must find a way...
Senior exec.
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
How's it going upstairs?
To warn him.
Flynn!
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
Come on in...
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
For sure...
I'm your program?
Way to go! We're haulin'!
Meanwhile, he might find it.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
I'm sorry -
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
Hah.
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
Greetings, program...
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
What about our friend - Sark?
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
Not us, I hope.
There's another beam!
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
Hey... !
We have to talk.
So...how's the world of serious science?
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
Do you know what he's talking about?
Why is everything...like this?
Nice...
You bitch.
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
Why?
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
Station wagon?
What's the plan?
Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
Son of a bitch!
Just hang a minute.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
Hello, Harry.
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
Natasha?
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
Is it working yet?
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
As much as you used to?
And you've got one.
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Yes.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
Hello, Alabama.
You got that playing basketball?
The forager's back.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
I didn't get any chicken.
Has he looked through it yet?
'Bout twelve.
No. Not particularly.  How come?
How 'bout me what?
What do you want to know?
What's your favorite color?
What's your favorite movie star?
Wow. What a swell place to work.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
What?
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
She's with me.
You goin' out?
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
The zoo.
What the fuck did you bring that for.
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
How 'bout me what?
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Leave the gorillas.
No. No you're not.
No. Not yet.
I can see what you mean.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Wanna count your money?
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
What makes you think I could do that?
No shit?
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
I don't believe you.
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
Where'd he come from?
That was a good fuckin' movie.
But a fuckin' baggie.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
Exactly room-mates.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
We're very close!  Because of you!
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
I need to go.
I have to go.
What?
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
Are you hurt?
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
Plan?  What are you talking about?
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
No, thank you.
Might be tight.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
What?  What did you say?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
Will be.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
Where in Mexico would you like--
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
You want somethin'?
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Hey.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
No charge.
It is morning.
What was that all about?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Yes.  Yes it is.
I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
Who was that on the phone?
They look nice.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
There's someone in the house.
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
Jesus.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
You're not from around here, are you?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
Did you like it; me watching you?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
You never did answer my question.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
I'm guessing no.
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
You live pretty good.
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
John?  John where are you going?
What was I supposed to do?
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
John . . .?
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
John, throw me the keys.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.
Like you don't know.
About things.  About your wife.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
That's a bit much.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Do we shake hands?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
Christ, Jake, please--
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
I asked you a question.
Got any requests?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
What the hell are you talking about?
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Give it to me!
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
Thirty-thousand dollars.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
But, Senor--
You can't do that yourself?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
I think I've heard that before.
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Who the hell is this!?
Yeah...
Accident.
Hey!
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
What makes you say that?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
It's not what you think, Jake.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
Oz.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
So?
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Accident.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
Soda.  You got any soda?
I call the sheriff.
I don't know your real name.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
Still playing?
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
I don't know how.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
There is no us, remember?
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
Why?
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
Which you don't have.
Heineken?
Morning Grace.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
What about Jeb?
Okay.
Do you remember me getting sick?
I've come to a decision.
Megan?
I remember you.
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
Have you ever tried to develop it?
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
That's not what I witnessed David.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
I'll just shoot him once.
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
Twelve years.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
Well, go get it then.
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
What's all that wood?
You could run off them two cowboys.
What's your name?
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
Duke.
But he was called...
Ned's share?
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
N-no, sir?
William Munny, yeah.
I could of... easy.
Yeah, I guess so.
What for?
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
She's passed on, Kid.
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
When we gonna double back?
You still think he's in there?
Yup.
Did... you... get... him?
Take a drink, Kid.
Wha... what f-for?
I... I... think I'm... shot.
You sure you ain't armed?
She gave me the evil eye.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Yeah.
Shit.
Jesus.
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
No.
Worms was comin' out.
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
Did you... did you... ?
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
They want more time to think about investing.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
They'll never stop.
That's enough, Edie.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
Why don't you just calm down'
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
Tough break.
How are you, Keaton?
Let's say for example -
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
Someplace else, then.
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
No.
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
Why didn't you say anything?
Then why didn't you help him?
But Keaton...
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
Because he was my friend.
You think he's..?
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
What does it mean?
...I was one of a group of...
Yes.
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
I'm on the staff of...
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
No.
You've just said you signed it.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
... that's all right.
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
...I made a reservation at...
Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
I appreciate--a man as busy as--
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
Yes.
The most respected ...
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
Thank you ...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
And ask me what?
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Mr. Alito, please.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
Hello, I'm calling from...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
I've got to work.
Not if you don't grow up...
No.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Hi, Mickey ...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
Are you out of your mind...?
...I have to stand up for her...
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
What did she do?
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
... I understand ...
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
Who told you that?
I used to be a nurse.
A single hour.
Well, well, well.  Huh?
Dr. Towler...
Huh.  And why is that?
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
Almost a year.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
It's not my line.
Ernie's.
Yes.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
What happened?
Do you live here in the hotel?
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
An hour?
I'll take care of you.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
No.
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
But Scottie, you don't have to!
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
Judy --
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
You don't even want to touch me.
Where shall we go for dinner?
Mmmm.
That's what I had in mind.
Scottie!
Where are you going?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
Love me... keep me safe...
You don't remember.
This afternoon.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
Would you like some coffee?
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
Well... anywhere in particular?
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
And no birds sing.
No birds live here.
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
Where?
Yes...
Where were you born?
No!... No!
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
What do you remember?
A grave...
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
Here with you.
And it's a all real.
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Let me go.
Yes... you run this hotel.
Oh, yes!
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
It's where you belong.
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
Normal.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Sorry, old man. Work.
That!?!
For what?
Nothing to tell.
Out!
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Just wander.
Did you need it?
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
What have you been doing?
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
What is it, a still life?
Yes! That's it!
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
Don't point at me.
Go home!
More.
What do you think you are doing?
Just stop.
Adam! Calm down.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
I know and I'm honored...
No way.
So who's the lucky guy?
What's goosed?
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
What are you going to do?
Take care of business.
I don't know...
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
The hell I did!
False.
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
You said nobody would miss her.
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
Easy Micheal.
Stop.
Government cutbacks.
What do you mean, you think so?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
What?
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
Why? What's his problem?
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
I need your help.
We're leaving in three hours.
That's sweet.
Nesting?
Hello.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
What!
What's the word on the chairs?
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Do you love me?
You killed a prostitute.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
Move the bodies.
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
But...
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
It means she's insecure.
Pup corn?
Okay great. What will that be?
...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
That's our plan.
Good times.
She's dead.
Right.
Stop this, stop this.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Don Amalio!
Enedina and Paco ...
You have no feelings toward ...
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
How could anybody behave like that?
Evil.
How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child!
You must think I'm mad.
What's the matter with you?
She isn't my cousin.
And this chest?
Why?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
She's left.
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
How are you today?
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Don't say that.
Stop this!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
There's been an accident.
A black bull came.
What's going on, Moncho?
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
I don't know.
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
I'm still making adjustments...
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
You catching my drift?
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
You all right?
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son—of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
Parker -— stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you——
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
Lindenmeyer?
Where the hell are you going?
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you——
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
Aren't you going to watch with me?
What are you talking about?
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>... 
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
...this is a snappy song....
Izzat the thing...
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 
...where?
What are you talking about?
We are virtually certain it isn't...
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
<u>Do</u> it...
It won't hold.
Gemme a plane.  Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago.  O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
Yes

Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...

You're tired, Ronnie.
None of these are ours.  <u>None</u> of em are ours....  ....that's <u>real politik</u>, Buddy.
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
Pride of a job-well-done...
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.
Heavy weather East of here.
To preserve their Way of Life.
I have.
How much...?
What do you want the kid to say?
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
...uh ... No, that's...
Why Albania?
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
President's speech.
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
In the Folk Music Section.
Where is he now?
...we get our hands on him?
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  <u>Isn't</u> he...
 A slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna <u>deal</u> with it, we just, I need a little readjustment...we need to re<u>think</u>...
We're going home.  We're going home together...
I'm tired.
You see?  What's the lesson here?  <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up.
What're you doing?
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
Hold it a minute, Benny, willya?
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...?  Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, <u>Terror</u> comes...
Keep Talking....
...what do you got?
Public Domain.
You like it?
It's tough to rhyme.
I'm just talking about the Hats.
...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
Yup.
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
No, I think..
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
Oh really.
Grand Marnier.
Buddy boy, how ya doing?
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
It concerns his future!
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
Then get out and close it behind you.
Sell?
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
I don't know anything!
He never told me...
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
I don't understand.
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
I guess I'll head back...
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Where is it?
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
And what do you want?
I don't.
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
Hi.
Why?
Any better and I'd be guilty.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Thank you Jenkins
Hello?
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Oh that explains everything.
Well?
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
Anyone else not coming?
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
I started seeing things.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
No.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
How you holding up?
You are?
Thanks, but I'm fine.
Oh my god.  You bought it.
Yep.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
The planchette?
Oh...
Jody, she's alive.
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
I guess not.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
Tired?
You are so brilliant.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
He killed her.
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
I didn't do that.
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
...Don't get all...
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
Sweetheart--
Do I have everything?
I...
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
But I don't remember.
I may have seen her on campus.
I take it your not mad at me.
What's the matter?
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
You should have tried harder.
She did it.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
I don't believe you.
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
Then you wear it.
Who the hel1 -
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
I don't want the -
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
She didn't feel them
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
Michael...  Do what you can.
Lasher - bring us through!
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
Go away!  I don't want you here.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
I LOVE him!
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
Yessss...
My jury's still out on that,
Harder...
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Hello...?
She - she said I - I was a ---
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
BRIAN...
I'm sorry?
So what do you do?
I don't know
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
then why did you marry her -
What didn't you like about her?
Why should I?
Yes...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
Just put it in my room
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
Dr STECKLER?
See? Did you see that?
Someday, I'll find out.
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
Well?
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
Dad, please.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
Of course we are.
It's okay. You need me?
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
Teddy? I was thinking.
Hmmm?
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
You're on the next plane home.
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
I didn't forget.
I'm trying to help.
Then I'll write about YOU.
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
I don't get the distinction.
Don't write that part.
Funny you should say "peachy."
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
Tell me more.
That's hard to believe.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
You called the cops on us?
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
Really? You'd do that for me?
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
About Suzie?
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
You okay?
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
Then what?
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
I don't know what to say...
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
Yeah, maybe, a little.
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
Ms. Toller?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
I say something funny?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Is there some reason why you're here?
Curiosity, I guess.
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
Where, the mall?
Don't forget the car wash.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
That was about as grim as it gets.
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
Almost?
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
It's not a guy...
Relax.  We're almost there.
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
He calls it the Tarantula.
Anyone?
She's perfectly safe.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
This is Colonel Richards.
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
I've even printed my own currency.
The first.
Easy now.
Dr. Pemberton?
They're coming.
Thank you, friend.
Say what?
You a woodcutter?
Are you a warrior?
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
Did she ask about me?
Who?
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
Get back here, Rool!
Madmartigan.
She's hungry.
This is not going well.
Milking?
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
Your hole is healed, then?
You know who?
Just us.
You have no right to keep us here.
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
Buttons are Hochmut.
Hochmut?
Anything against zippers?
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
You know carpentry?
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
Won him over just like that.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
I was being foolish?
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
I hear you.
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
Tight. But I'm working on him.
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
Is this where we're going?
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Uhh -- yeah --
If she?
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
Who are you?
Uhhhh -- yes...
Oh --
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Hickory!
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
Are you ready now?
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Aw, come, come, come --
That's right.  What's she doing?
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Did they hurtcha?
...don't talk.
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
Ohhhh --
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
Real courage. That's what we want.
What happened?
Here --   Come on.
You humbug!
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
No, sir!
That's right.
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Let's.
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
Well, I --
But I still want one.
What happened to Len Tashka?
Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
Zukovsky...
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  I’ve known that girl all her life. I’m not sure she knows what she’s walking into.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
Consider me ungrateful.
She’ll get over it.
Vodka martini.
...what?
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn’t have to sleep with you to find that out.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
Really Bond, couldn’t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
Mother of God.
It’s heading for the oil terminal.
Any word from him?
Why?  What's the problem?
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
A whore fucking.
The bearer of bad news.
Blake?  Dead?
Would you like me to stay?
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
What is it?  How does it work?
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
. . . What?
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
No comment.
Am I free to go?
He's a little farther gone every time.
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
Looks like a diner.
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Not bad for a gimp.
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
We're not after car thieves here.
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
Yorgi asked me to.
I was invited. What's your story?
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Where's he headed?
Toadies right behind.
You okay?
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
You're serious?
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
What are you going to do?
Who?
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
It does indeed, Max.
Yes, my dear, he is.
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
No!
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
Is it that music?
MMmmm.
I promise.
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Darling!
Surprised!
Darling!?!
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
Good night.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
There seem to be quite a few books.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
Fron kon steen!
Break that old man's violin.
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
I see.
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
What are you doing here?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Do you have the name I wrote down?
What?
What?
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
How do you know it was a 'he'?
I'm a failure.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Well, this explains the music.
All right -- give it to him!
I see what you mean.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
MMMMmmmmm!
His schwanzstucker.
How do you know they're done?
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
