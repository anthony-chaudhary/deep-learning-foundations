Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Forget French.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
What good stuff?
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
You might wanna think about it
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
He was, like, a total babe
I guess I'll never know, will I?
No! I just wanted
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
It's just a party. Daddy.
No, but
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Thirty-two.
Get out!
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
A deal's a deal.
Do what?
We're not.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
I know a lot more than that
You -- covered in my vomit.
Seven-thirty?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Funny, you're the only one
I know, just let me sleep
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Maybe.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Pleasant?
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
You never disappointed me.
No one else knows
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
I didn't care about the money.
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
When I go?
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
Yeah.
I'm likin' you guys better
Make anyone cry today?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
Are we going to argue?
Not bad.
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
Ask him if he will help.
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
New worlds create new people.
What did they say about Granada before today?
Surely you can do anything you want.
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
The land is there.  I know it!
You tell that to them!
Yes, Your Majesty.
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
Then why?
Because he is not afraid of me.
No.  No way.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Your mother was blind?
Back in the Czech Republic?
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
What about back home?
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Yeah, right.
Yeah.
Vodka tonic.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
A timer.
Any I.D.?
It's okay.
No.  I'm okay.
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
Stay here.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
I'll call it... tails.
I don't have a girlfriend.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
I kill someone famous.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
I am butcher.
Dog food.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Two weeks holiday.
How long are you planning to stay?
He doesn't speak English.
New York's finest.  This is his case.
In here, says he wants a million.
Okay.
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Yes, the money is good.
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
I want to hear everything he said.
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
Aren't you tired?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two more.
Roger.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Thank you.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Yes, really, thank you very much.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
I see.
Roger.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Yeah, I've been busy.
How about chargin' the battery?
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Great, just great.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
The bet's off.
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
He's after your money.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Shit.
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
I don't know.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
You made the front page.
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Where is he?
Tell me.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Five.  On credit.
You know exactly where they are!
I'm fucked!
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
Why?  What's wrong with me?
No thank you.
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Of course.
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Yes. Of course..
Perfect.
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
Do you love her?
I would like to have died in peace...
I was talking to the cat.
How many points you got left on your license?
Uh... at least fifty.
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Does it get any better or what!
He's on vacation.
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
I told you not to read all that crap!
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Because...
Talk English Doc.
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
How much time is left?
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
...I can't wait to be among you.
Do you know how much I missed you?
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
Tom...
Nobody knows anything.
A fellow investor.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
Machine's in?
I remember him.
Leave him alone.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
I don't know...
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Yeah.
Something like that.
Tell me what happened.
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
You got absolute zero.
Of what sort?
That's right.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
Never mind how I found you.
They're no friends of mine.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
I'm asking.
Enlighten me.
Fuck you.
Max.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
I'm a working stiff, pops.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
It's their Presidential Suite.
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
I try to be.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
I'm telling you it's not that.
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
I don't know.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
I didn't mean to...
I had to ask.  I apologize.
We're all like that.
No.
What?
Will you let me look?
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
What... ?
No...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
I know.  Uh...Alice.
Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
Who?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
So?
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
About Freddy?
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
Don't worry, honey
You're not taking my baby!
My name is...
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
He's inside you, where he hides.
Alice...
No, the Dan part was nice...
That's the only reason you're alive...
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
But I've seen her grave.
Who?
I want to talk about the baby.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
I think you're right.
Somewhere down there?
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Something wrong?
Wonderful!
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
What about time...?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
Who with?
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
Minus three.
Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Tell me.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Yeah.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
You can't buy Wade off.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
Wonderful!
Oh.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
No, I mean whereabouts.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
He sure as hell won't.
You know.
I guess they're stupid.
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
It's stupid.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Jesus, why?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Fine.
You're a policeman.
Huh?
So?
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
We should talk.
Yeah, lots.
Hi honey.
Did you get his number?
For a while.
Said what?
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Okay.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
I don't know for Christ's sake!
What the hell are you talking about?
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.
Jack?
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Atta-go.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
Everything you know is from me.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
You think Jack shot him?
How was she?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
I don't know. You tell me.
Not particularly.
Yeah.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
I'm sure he's busy.
Back at The Fishbowl?
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
Jim... for godsake!
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Got it.
Lemme take a look.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
I know he left you behind.
Yes
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Jim...
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
Yes, sir.
Please... don't start with me.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
I might still have a few chips left.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Ted!
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
I'm so excited, Simon.
That's not possible.
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
What?
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
No.  Poached.  Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Don't try to stop me!
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Thank you. Cream?
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
And a little ice.
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
Every day.
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
I'm Randy.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Yeah...
That's right.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
Uh, Matthew...
Screw me?  That can't be right.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
Ta ss'trakyona'...
We can't let him get away.
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
Hear me out...
Bullshit!
Sorry to disappoint you.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
Sir?
Aye-firmative.
About seventeen days.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
Hudson, give us a break.
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Uh, what's next?
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Look!
Newt, wait!
Right here, baby.  Right here.
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Certainly!
Indeed.
In a harem.
A brothel.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Extremely clever.
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
I want to go!
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Where?
Oh, leave me alone.
You borrowed money from your mother?
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
Oh, damn!
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Oh, thank you, sir!
What do you mean?
Why you?
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
He asked me to stay.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
Money! Money!
Do you hear him? Do you?
Hey!
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
You can't be Herr Mozart!
May I try it?
Majesty.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Why not?
Well, look at them.
Ah-ha.
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
It couldn't be better.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
This is just a game, Papa.
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Really? What is it he's writing?
Is he working?
Opera? Opera!
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
German!
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Can I see it?
Why not?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Ah. Italian?
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
How could I not?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
Who are you?
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
Do you mean that?
What?
I'm too young to be so sick.
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Would you? Actually, you could.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
Do you believe in it?
Come. Let's begin.
So now - A minor. Suddenly.
Also identical?
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
So?
What do you want?
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
Here in Vienna.
You cannot say that!
I did.
No, you didn't!
I poisoned his life.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
I can't wait.
Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
Who is she?
Can we come in?
Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
Yes, I believe he did.
Warn him?
And what else?
Dr. Hirsch?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
He's fine. We'll come right over.
I doubt it. But it's something to do.
What?
Call me Alex.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
My best friend. My very best friend.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Now I'm embarrassed.
I'll let you know the next full moon.
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
Bathroom.
See you later.
The zoo?
Right.
No!
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Yes.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
Okay.
Nice to see you.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
You ask them.
Beware the moon?
Come on, I'm freezing.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I heard that.
Let's just keep walking.
Walk away, Jack.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
What?!
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
What?!
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
What do you think?
Thank you.
Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
Why don't we ask him?
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
Campari and soda would do nicely.
And what, Sergeant?
That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
We'll find him, not to worry.
But listen, Tom, I—
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
Yeah?
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That don't do us any good.
You don't have to do nothing.
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
—running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Well, what?
No.
Why, Cyril, you're insane—
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
The theatre?
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Yes, sir.
Got my letter?
But I haven't . . .
Why pick on him ?
So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they—
Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
The ten dollars.
Yes.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Oh now, don't be silly.
Mr. Williams . . .
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
Yes, sir.
It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
I don't know.
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
I guess so.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
What have you done?
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Best damn plan I heard all war.
Two.
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
He's planning a job.
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
I think I recognize you.
How?
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
I could use the walk.
Sorry.
It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
Yep.
I got us through the War all right.
Missed you too, cousin.
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
Me get heap firewater --
Then why can't I go in there?
I think he's already feeling better.
I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
You can shut up now.
Next time try "fat and haggard."
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
And we're good at it.
Oh yeah.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Yeah Jimmy?
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
You didn't want to farm?
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
And what's this right girl like?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Little ones.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
Let me see that.
What?
You are a hell of a woman.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
Lyla Devereux.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Dorsia's nice.
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Are we here?
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
Take it off.
Yes, Courtney?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Really?
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
No, he doesn't.
You saw the ad in the Times?
Yes, naturally.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
I guess you're right...  THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
Oh really? That's great.
Just say no?
Can you bring Mr...
Yes, Patrick?
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Forget it.
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
Jean-I'm not-
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
What are I doing?
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
She's from...France.
I want the number, idiot.  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
No.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
You sure? I can always get you a lime.
Nice. Very nice.
Thanks.
No problem. 
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
People just...disappear.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
So who was he with?
What am I gonna do?
Listen, what's your name?
Al.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
...But?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
Isn't that -- extreme?
It was a hate crime.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
Remember Lyle Barton?
What?
Milo, you --
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Don't we have any chopsticks?
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
Sure, I'll see what I can do.
Wanna be a part of history?
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
He's pretty tight with his family.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?
...Do I?
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
The wrong place?
The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
I'm okay. It's going well!
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
Longitude 109 --
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa.  I swear to God, it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it.  Let's run a printout on card entries.
I'm calling Gary.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
...Something like that. Yeah.
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Why would you do a thing like --
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
No, no. Never.
What about "60 Minutes."
What?
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
I don't know --
That's lame, isn't it?
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
Did you tell Alice?
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
Hey, how are you?
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Thank you.
Be careful.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
We won, Austin.
No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Yes?
That's not your mother, that's a man!
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
I beg your pardon?
What?
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
How do you know?
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
Go! Just go!
No, this is me in a nutshell.
Oh, behave!
Don't worry!
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Dr. Evil?
They're mutated sea bass.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
What did you say?
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
How's Austin?
Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
I love you, Vanessa.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
Fear ...
... love ...
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
The Institute ... the funding ...
Next assignment?
Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
You're mad.
Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --
The result would be ...
Then what's stopping you?
One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
Did you say formal? I must dress.
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
Was I?
Is that all?
Not for a moment.
You're playing games.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you played by the rules.
You lied.
No idea who. No idea why ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
It's called Black Leather.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
Where are you going?
But --
The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
I know all this.
Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Anyone particular in mind?
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
Mother and Father know best.
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Not interested.
I'm marrying Debbie.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
I've tried to change her mind.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
I'm going now, Cole.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I don't know... I just feel scared.
You better not have too much joy.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
I think I screwed that one once.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
Good.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
I just want to be alone.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
The best table in the house.
I'm proud of you, lad.
You got it.
Be gentle.
They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
He's alive.
So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
What, you've never seen one before?
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
Yeah? What have you been up to?
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
You think that's really any of your business?
Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
Uh huh.
I don't know anything about it.
What'll you do?
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
Yeah? Airtight?
Yeah.
Four months.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
I'll be there, goddamn it!
Here we go...
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you.
Putty? On both doors?
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
Absolutely.
I need that report, Lt.
Alderman.
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
"The Strawberries"?
I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
I want 15 on the Mets.
Are you sure?
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
You ain't happy about the green light?
Damn skippy.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
De-la-croix.
Different.
That can be done.
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
How you sound?
I won't do it anymore.
Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
I'm wid it.
I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
It's me, Peerless.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
Always keep 'em laughing.
And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
This is Cheeba.
Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
I don't want to hear it.
You sound like the media.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
You sing and dance?
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
Around...
...too late, maybe around...
I don't know who I am.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
You don't read, do you?
Maybe you need to start.
What?
I know I won't be your puppet.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
What is your uncle's name?
It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I don't know.
Your honor must lower his voice.
As you please.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
Have you had one?
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
Then you must get it.
All the same, you must name an amount.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
Yes, of course.
Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
Tender Hegenheim.
What do we do?
We don't know. West is dead.
You did Basic here?
Tell me about them.
That'd be my reaction too --
He's lying.
I didn't shoot West --
Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Bullshit.
Full clip to the body --
We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
What happened to "degrees"?
Well?
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
Where are they!
Maybe he...
It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
Yes.
Move him.
Why?
Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
Best time for banal chit-chat.
Something like that. You?
So noted.
What point?
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
Little bit.
Are you sure?
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
Poor fucker my ass...
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is.
Thank you.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Fine, I will.
My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Was she nekkid?
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
What's your name, Giant?
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
What did he say?
I will.
I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
Son?
It would kill you, huh?
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
Go out with me.
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
I wasn't expecting you.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
Yes.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
Probably tonight.
They met at Auburn.
But it's romantic.
What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
How much time does he have left?
Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
So you never bought any land.
The sets were good.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
That's not a burn.
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
What?
Yes. I know.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
You must have a visa or something...
What?
No. It's not that.
What? What does he want?
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
He wants the money from your bank.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Right. Okay. Good.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
They go.
In the world.
I don't have any money.
It's none of your business.
Oh Jesus.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
But, you know, so what?
I don't hate you.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You...
Please, there's no... Oh.
I don't have nothing.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Because it was a lie.
Goodbye.
No. What? No. I know.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
Cash.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Well, that makes it easier.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
You been home yet?
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
I don't love ya no more.
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Wait. He left.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
No ma'am.
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...  Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in.  Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!
To freedom.
I'm here with you.
By myself?
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
Now, hold up.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
Nuh-uh.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Not like that.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
What?
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
Ronnie...
Got in a little accident.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
All that shit's on aisle 5.
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
I don't think he'd feel it.
Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
High spirits, desire, commitment.
You'll take care of that.
I wasn't expecting you.
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
There she is!
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Nick --
Nick, you can't do this.
We need the plate to negotiate with.
Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
You met her.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
The cheese...
Save it, I already took the tour.
Yeah.
Why?
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
Well stocked.
Oh?
And what can he do for you?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
You're just all so... so different.
You're androids.
Of course not.
Dr. Tyrell?
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.
Where do we start?
You start.
The umbrella.
Vodka!
Yeah?
Too old.
You mean the snake.
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
Yeah.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
I wish I could.
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
Same thing.
Oh.
We sure did.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Beautiful.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
What's that?
Thank-Q!
For how long?
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
Right.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
What is it?!
It's Perry!
Over this?
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Why doesn't it never work out?
What?
Why not go to work for me?
Doing what?
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
Okay.
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
Because I want to get married.
One who's not a mutant.
I told you I've never driven before!
I like it.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Yes!
Good-bye!
And don't be so obvious!
It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
Eve, I'm sorry.
Yes, Eve?
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
Yes, sir.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.
What's baseball?
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
Shit is a French word?
Yes, sir. It's true.
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
1959.
It's so small.
No.
Yeah?
The recovery is very impressive.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
How old do I look?
Up there!!
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Yes, ma'am.
A psychiatrist?!
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
All back East.
Yeah.
Well, put it down and come in!
I never know anymore.
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Yes!
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
Yes! That's right!
Amen.
Some time.
What can I offer you, Eve?
Oh, my God...
Well, that's blunt!
I think...it...works.
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
No.
What?!!
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
Stop!
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
You did? A human ear?
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Yes?
Anything you can tell me?
Yeah. I get it.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
You're all through with this now?
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
No. What is happening?
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
Falling.
Yes.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
Dorothy. No!
No.  Hi baby.
Baby wants to fuck.
You want to see him too, right?
If you want to.
Speak to me Fucker.
No thanks. What does that mean?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
That sounds great!
Are you feeling okay?
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Yes.
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Okay, yeah, call.
You saw a lot in one night.
That's what I thought.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
Okay, okay.
Goodnight.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Okay. Great!
NO.
No.
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Okay.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Aye.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
Aye.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Aye.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
Yeah?
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
The Greeks. The Italians.
The Sicilians.
Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
I...
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
Hey Murph.
Hey, Murph.
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
Yes.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
The... The funny man.
He's a nigger.
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Right. The blond guy.
Dignan, it's --
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
You think we're going to be chased?
There's another stocker, right?
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
Well, then cut it in half.
I keep it for emergencies.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
No. We didn't.
Bob?
This was in fourth grade.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
You were asleep.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
How much?
What is it?
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Did that hurt?
As a person?
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
Careful. Check his pulse.
Where's Kumar?
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Dignan, I --
Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
Absolutely.
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
Hector woudn't do anything.
What was that?
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
I'm not playing any more golf.
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
Sixty days?
Were you adopted, Bob?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
You're Anthony?
Feel this.
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
Yes. I did.
Let's just go.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
I don't want to talk about it.
So it's my fault?
He wouldn't move.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
Come on, Dignan.
I'm going back.
I know it's not.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
I never agreed to that.
All right! Backyard! Right now!
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
It's locked.
No, it's not.
Nice to meet you.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Anything else?
I want to know about Treadstone.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
Excuse me.
May I finish?
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
What do you have, Danny?
Okay... 
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
I don't want you to forgive me.
Pamela Landy?
I don't know! Why would I lie?
I did.
Conklin up front.
I'll get the book.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
It might have.
I want to come in.
Who?
What?
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
Who's this?
Did you?
And why is that?
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
Invade?! That's impossible, it --
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
He will. I know he will.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
I have ordered conscriptions...
You fancy him.
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
That depends on the man.
I will not.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
A common thief.
They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!
If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
Thank you for accepting.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
Peace is made is such ways.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
What?
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
Sure...
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
No, protecting her.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
I thought you were a December baby.
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
Fuck off, frat boy.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
I dunno.  Just being weird.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
Like how?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I walk differently?
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
Different? How?
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
...yes.
Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
Who's to say you can't make things better?
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
We'll find out soon enough.
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Oh, yes, please.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
Come up here a minute.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
Put them on the table.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
Yes?
He suggested I ask you.
Ask me?
-- Is what?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
Thank you. I try.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Thank you.
Are you quite finished with us?
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Good day.
Perhaps.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
But everybody's having such a good time.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
Our entertainment is enough.
Victor Laszlo?
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Oh, but I just told you. --
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
I haven't the slightest idea.
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
-- You thought what?
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Yeah?
Not right now.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Feels so good to lie here.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
Fix raft first.
Water water water --
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
Okay.  Sure.
They're harder to do than they look.
Oh?  You've tried?
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
I had it on the island with me.
Not if you work for FedEx.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Let me guess, Russia came up?
For when I travel?
I have to.
You want to.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
Yeah?
I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.
And how was your Christmas?
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
Sure.
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it.
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
You fucked us over.
That's why you're a gambling man.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
That's all there is.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
Okay...
Just a little privacy.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
Well, we have to help her!
No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
She knows how to take care of herself.
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
Yes, I *have*!
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
That's true.
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
What's a nanny do?
What's an immigrant?
That's why Kong loves her!
It's okay--I don't mind.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
You still doin' it too fast!
Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
Obviously.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Of course.
So what?
Almost.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
Sorry, Homer...
What's lucky about that?
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
Everything looks in order.
The Anti-Christ?
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
Isn't it always?
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
I was doing it for them.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
Mob?
We're going to give him the money back?
Let's go, Jake?
Calls?
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
I think two million.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Sure.
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Don't worry about it.
And some new clothes.
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
It's more than that.
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
Lily... Jesus Christ...
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.
Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
I'm sorry.
What?
Pretty much.
I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
We're here.
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
Peace of mind.
What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns.
Put your hand down. I don't high five.
I'll take you up on that.
All men are cheats.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
What are you talking about?
That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition.
Eight-fifty.
Seven-fifty.
We all played the field.
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work.
You mean I won't resist them.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
Why not?
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
No. Answer it!
You're already alone.
I want to buy a car.
Don't let yourself down.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
Just an accident. Nothing.
I know that. But you can now.
I told you, all bets are off.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Who...
Thanks.
Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
Rough life, Jack.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
No.
We check every four days.
They've been tested.
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
Does he win?
She was a real asset. But what could I do?
Eventual supernova.
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Detonation in twenty minutes.
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
This is fun.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Why don't you have more time?
And you can only do it once, right?
...nine seconds...
In a second.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Commander Powell is dead.
Wha?
I like it up here.
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Ah... pity, pity...
Sorry.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Oh, yeah?
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
You mean until you showed up?
You're roommates?
No time.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Same old story.  Not interested.
I'll make it worth your while.
They took my daughter.
No...
Mommy, where are you?
Thank God.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
Lauren's not my wife.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
Is the social studies class over for today?
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
How well do you remember the lab?
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
You believe that?
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
I don't know what to say.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
Let go of my hand.
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
Nothing on Hannah?
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
Bastard...
You and me both.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Straight.
Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
You know what I'm saying.
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
I have sincere eyes.
I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
I'm a toy to her.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
She was the one--
More like deployed in bed asleep.
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
For a change.
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
Theo's dead.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
Hawk.
Yeah, a man's drink...
What's it worth to you?
You got in the car, didn't you?
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
What's in Sandusky?
For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
Check!
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
DUDES!
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Nah. Couldn't be.
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
Not if I shoot first!
I don't even think you have a gun!
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
Yeah.
Theoretically.
Like a spear.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Not until like... eighth grade.
Our saviour...
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
Well...
Maybe she's asleep.
What do you mean?
My mom is gone.
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
When did you stop taking your medication?
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
I know, Dad.
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Frank.
Follow him where?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
Then how is time travel possible?
When will this happen?
Where is he, Donald?
Goodbye, Donald.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Because you tell Mom everything.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
Donnie? You're a dick.
You can suck a fuck.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
Really?
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
-- red nose and ears. I know, I know.
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
That's it, I'm goin'...
C'mere. I love you so much.
Bitch!
Here, have some.
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
I know.
I got a hairdo.
Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
Okay?
Ohio...
This pageant's like a roach motel.
I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
Take a letter.
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
"My dear"...
"My dear President"...
Send for my car...
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
She did.
Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
Anything else? 
Well, with you two fellows on the other side, this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the door.
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
The population must increase With great rapidity.  We give a couple seven years To raise a family. If, by that time, there is no branch Upon the family tree, we stand 'em up against the wall - and Pop goes the Weasel.
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
That's it!  No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart.
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
What do you mean?
What is it?
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
I am very pleased to meet you.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
Yes.
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Yes.
It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
My... name is...
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
Yes.
Ohhh...
The children! May I see?
Of course.
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
...Can you cure me?
I thought as much.
Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
Oh no, I couldn't.
I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
No, John, not one that I can see.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
Very smart indeed.
Yes. John wants it.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
What are what?
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
Yes.
It was different...
But you LOVED her all the same...
But you don't realize....
Goodbye, Aud...
There is something I must ask the Gods...
No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
Really.
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
You've got to let me go!
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
About raping me?
About NOT raping you...
You DON'T like it, do you?
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
I didn't mean to!
I don't know! I just did!
What?
It saved my father!
I know!
I know. I know.
Don't you FEEL it?
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
But you're the Gods!
Keitel Blacksmith?
She MUST have a knife or something...
Mum! Dad!
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Oh...
My brother blacksmiths!
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
I must only let the red rage...
Easy, Dad!
Yes, Mother.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
Okay, I guess.
Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
I don't know what that means.
That's okay.
You're sure? It's cold.
What?
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
I think about that.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
You should stay.
Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
I want to have a baby.
You're not ready.
I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
Would you get me another, Joely?
It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
We did talk about Naomi.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Oh.
What are you doing?
I love you.
When?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
Your dried cum.
Long day thinking.
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
What? What do you mean?
What?
It's not somebody else.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
I'm sorry.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Yup.
Where?
Do you swear you didn't know?
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
Thanks, Stan.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Mary... please. This is hurting people.
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
You made me have an abortion.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
He went home sick.
Oh dear.
Of course. Please have a seat.
Yeah.
This one's history. Moving on...
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
Siwash, huh?
The Clock People?
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
Well.... er...
Whose fault was that?
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
I was a successful model once.
For magazines?
Yep.
You're the best?
A job for me?
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
Justin?
I think I found something...
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
The containment, Second Containment...
Will it work?
What?
You weren't there. I saw it.
You're okay now, it's over...
Trauma.
And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us why.
We'll make it.
"Another man?" Who?
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
A power drain --
Pressure?
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
The dark inside me.
How do you know all this?
Justin.
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
Negative.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
What about it?
It's 2041...
The Core...!
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
The "Other Place," what is that...?
Watch me.
What are you talking about?
Starck, give me a read.
We have a situation here...
They're gone.
Justin?
Let's go.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
What about the life readings you picked up?
Five seconds.
He's been past Mars?
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
Ship's log.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Relax, it's casual.
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
Where do you think? With Sue.
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
Five times.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
You've been working out.
Oh, it is.
They're not costumes.
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
But Johnny... you can't fly.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
That's what we're here to find out.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
You need a doctor.
Reed, we're running out of time.
Ben did this.
I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
I understand the business reasons.
Raising the shields.
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
Susan. What are you doing?
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
First door on your left!
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
I didn't say that.
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
Leave me alone.
Mark is a really nice boy...
Come on...
No. Are you crazy?
You first.
What? Are you all right?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I know it's yours.
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
Yeah?
Damone. It's Mark.
Mark. What happened to your date?
Sensitive -- what is that?
How often do you go?
Naw. Any good?
My brother is gonna shit.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Should we buy a frame for that?
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
It was nice.
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
But what are you going to do?
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
I couldn't make it in time.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
Well, you'll find out next year.
I know, everyone says that.
Yes.
Oh... yes.
Yeah. It's my sister's.
Not at all.
Sure.
Well... it's getting kind of late.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Holy shit!
Killed?
Tell me. What do you want?
Not where we operate.
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
A major!
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
My heart!
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
Jesus.
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
NO! Stop talking like that.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
This is a fucking nightmare.
Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
And the head?
Well, justice is funny.
There's a tunnel.
Follow me.
Shit!
Fuck you too.
Fuck no.
My truck.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
Good.
Nothing.
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
F-f-fuck you.
Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
Am I too heavy for you?
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Nothing, just lookin'.
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
Go!!!
Stop her!
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
What did we say about lying?
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
Thank you.
I didn't have much to do with it.
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
...Then go.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Occupation?
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
You don't know what you want.
Eight stories.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
No, they don't, do they?
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!
What's left of my blood.
Think I'll have a glass.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
I took the early rounds.
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
I know. Don't tell anyone.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
I already have.
You're taking me home!
It's your fan mail, little sister.
You kill me, Mama.
What's wrong?
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
I will, I promise.
Don't I know you?
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
I see.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
Oh for Christ's...
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
I was watching.
And he drove me to mine.
Then why weep for him?
Worse.
Your crime... as well as mine.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
It's been months. It's not like him.
I should go. I should leave today.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
And you?
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
So do I.
Open this door for no-one!
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
Can you think of a better reason?
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
You've been going round-the-clock?
This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
Philosophical?
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.
Why?
Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
You know of it?
Madness?
Jack? Marcie? Ned?
I guess...
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
You want to leave?
Thanks, Alice.
I don't know.
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
Good point.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
Dancer.
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Have you ever been there before?
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
Where is the little lady?
Yes.
You best better get it done, Pops.
Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.
Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
Mexico.
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
He didn't recognize shit.
No.
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
She's in the other room.
I don't know, you just passed out.
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
No, sir.
Across the board, sir.
Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
California.
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
You'll think about my offer?
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
... two... one... MARK!
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
Get it up!
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Is this my glory, sir?
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
Me?  Why me?
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
I don't know, I don't care.
What?
Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado...
Which is guy-speak for...
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
Not me.  You?
Educate her, Pyro.
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
I think you're the liar.
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
Women.
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
We know, Audrey.
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
And you think this creature is one of them?
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
You're kidding, right?
And you're beautiful...
What?
It's Tatopoulos.
Follow me.
We know.
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.
Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
We know.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Is that the bathroom?
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
I won't and nothing you say-
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
I had the shot...
The guy is terminally selfish!
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
The ships are gaining...
He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
Oh.  Okay.
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
What's  your name, son?
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
Okay, now. But-
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
We're getting major structural damage.
The enemy is matching velocity.
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
It's suicide.
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
Guy... You probably don't remember me do you?   I was on the show in '82.  Episode 31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  "Crewman #6?"
We're doing episode 31?
Where'd they go? Back inside?
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
Computer, can it be repaired?
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Catch me later, okay?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.
Wh... Where are we?
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
Is that a fact.
The army can survive without me.
Same old story.
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
Lafayette will not be happy...
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
What do you know about these men!? They can stand against anything! They've seen more war than most field generals!  They are not cowards, sir!  They are not afraid!
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
Delighted, sir.
They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
Who's in command out there?
As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
Oh, come now...
A fleet?
George!  So good to be back!
No, I did not.  Really?  Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely?
They help me understand why we fight.
How can you say that?
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
I'm very aware of that.
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Martha!  For God's sake!
I want you to see our hospital.
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes...
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
You're out of your mind!
They can use their imaginations.
Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
How 'bout when you went down the stairs?
Your who?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
She can't talk right now.
Gimme an hour.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
You say look at you?
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
That's right.
You have a card in here?
Leo spanked a waitress?
I'm not the guy, Harry.
They always paid.
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
Harry, look at me.
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
One of his best parts.
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
His shrink's trainer.
Hey, Harry.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
He died.
Ask your man here.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
One of mine?
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
I'll find you, Leo...
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
That's right. Three percent.
Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...'
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Yeah. Right.  Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Then you've read it?
Sounds fair.
What do you get out of it?
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
Oh.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
You bet.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I don't have a dog.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Oh, yeah, sure.
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and out.
You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it.
Maureen.
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
What're you crazy?
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
What is it?
Hard to say.
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
How long, then?
Three, four days.
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
Yeah, yeah.
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
I don't know what you're talking about?
I think you know.
Maybe you can tell me then.
What?!
Conveniently enough for you.
Sorry.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
Sudden flashes of light.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
That much I think we've already established.
Maybe it was more than that.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
Of course they did.
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
And look what happened.
Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
A what?
The mooring hasn't come taught.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
How should I know?
Who?
Maxine.
Are you going to yell at me?
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
JUST DO IT!
No, really I --
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
What are you trying to say?
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
No.
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
Hi.
Yeah, well... hi...
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Good.
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Okay, okay!
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
She says she wants to MMPH!
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
What, is she black now?
It's always closed...
Should we leave a note?
Anthony's II!
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
No, really...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.
I don't believe you.
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
It just came yesterday...
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
Seymour does.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
Punk rock is over!
I know it's over, asshole, I --
Fine, and how are you?
Hey, I was only kidding!
Good luck...
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
Well are --
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
I really don't think it's a good idea.
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Jesus, Seymour.
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
Hooray for me.
What? Why?
No, Doofus... blow it out!
It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...
Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
How can you be so sure?
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
Well when can we do something?
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
No, of course not.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
What do you want?
I will if you want to.
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
No problem.
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
Right, exactly!
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
What are you talking about?
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
Do you have a check for me?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Am I to take it you want to live?
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
We have hunted since childhood.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Have you got that in writing? 
Does he speak English?
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed! 
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
Actually, no.
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
Nonsense.
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Thank you, Samuel.
Good news?
Since his beard was red.
Not even close.  What happened?
Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers-  -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible. 
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
I'm not even good for me.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
Ghostbusters.
Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
You've got to stop them.  Please!
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
You need the exercise.
Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
Good idea.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
Something good --
Do it!  Just do it!
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
No, the slime is rising.
I'm Peter --
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
I hate Jello.
Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
No, I just thought --
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Uuuuuuugh!!
... I thought it was the drug store.
Are you sick, Louis?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
I got the Twister game for later ...
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
All right.  What do you want to do?
I want to help you.
You're the best one in your row.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
You must have gotten the last copy.
All right.  Since you put it that way.
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
I don't believe in luck.
The EPA?  What's he want?
Why do you want to see it?
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
You talked to Gozer?
Full-stream with strogon pulse.
I'm worried, Ray.  It's getting crowded in there.  And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
That appears to be the case.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Anything!  Just make contact.
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
Look!
Me, too.
Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
Do you want posters, too?
Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
He left us at dawn.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books.  But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.
Would that Marcus had lived.
Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
I can see that...
No!
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
I'm sorry I took you in there.
Where is the car?
Yes, I do.
Did they ever find out?
Yes.
You mean the one who --
Is it because I'm here?
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
Yes.
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
Not exactly.
Could you bring it up?
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
What?
But it's light in there now.
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
Pardon?
Like what?
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Come on.
Right.
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
Don't you think he trusts us together?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Why is it?
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
Let me out!
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
I've got to go.
Thank you for taking me home.
Waiter!
Do you want to get it now?
Yes -- I think that would be good.
The number.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
You what?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
That you're afraid --
What?
You walk right out the door.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Not particularly.
Yes.
I'm curious.
Really. I want to know.
I was just kidding around.
You wouldn't.
How?
I don't believe you.
I just don't believe you would do that.
Where is Elaine?
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
Sir?
Yes, but I'm afraid --
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
I don't know. I want it to be --
Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
No. She doesn't know about it.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
I know.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
But why?
That's quite a statement.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Can you look through the glass.
This boy -- I'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar -- but before he does --
Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
Yes.
Need any help?
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
Why?
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
I have an idea working in my head... 
You might find a bullet through that head...
Who?
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
Aren't you?
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Yes -- I'd love to.
What do you want here?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
And...?
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
Yes -- I do understand.
You are beautiful!
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
For Vienna?
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
Why?
Oh, a Baron! 
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
No -- not at all.
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
I must have made a mistake.
Telegrams?
You're tired. I can see that.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
The Grand Hotel.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
No -- only occasional jobs. 
Skiing? 
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
No -- now.
Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
I understand perfectly.
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
I mean with the Manchester people?
All right.
And I said we didn't.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
You see -- what we are interested in --
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
Let us cancel the engagement.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
Oh -- but it can't be.
Take them back, Suzette.
You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end. 
The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
Again?
I don't know you.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
And if you do it wrong?
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
We're not really interested, Henry.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
You brought a case? Good.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
But what's wrong?
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
Only one tooth?
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
No. That was the point.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
This way's perfect.
Just a few bucks.
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
Just trying to help, Lilly.
NO!
You called the doctor, huh?
That's just Lilly's way.
I'm a salesman.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
He retired.
Upstate.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
I saw her.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
What?
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
That's natural.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
Girl scouts.
Where?
Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.
Care to join me?
Yes.
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
No shit?!
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
Then you come out here.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
Michael Meyers!
You okay?  You seem a little off.
Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
What is it?
I thought you were allergic to latex.
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Why?  You interested?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
Then they can watch.
Answer what?
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
Danny!!!
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
Samhain.
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
I'm gonna wet my pants.
We'll see.
Home is important to a man.
You know what gets me?
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
Must have changed that law.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
This room is full of ghosts.
You're lucky, boy.  My house is gonna be filled with people.
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
Go home!
Go home.
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
So long, Colonel.
Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone.
First Nagasaki--now this.
How about breakfast, wife?
The educational process.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
What's this?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
They were enemies.  We were at war.
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Life has denied me that thrill.
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
Oh hell.
"The sting."
Tell me that.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
I don't know.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
You're supposed to get hurt!
No, no, no, no, no.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Penelope!
You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
I'm talking to you gently now.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
Situation.
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
What a honeymoon.
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
You're a woman, aren't you?
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
Such as?...
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
Yes.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
Why not?
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.
It's always locked.
He's dead, you know.
Oh dear.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
I've never heard of it.
What brought you back?
You haven't heard me yet.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
Poison.
Don Quixote.
My violin is avenged!
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
There was so much going on.
Jesus.
What will you do, Colonel?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Ja?
Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol.  Peace.
I don't care what she wears.
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
Still lives with his mother.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I was afraid to ask.
I don't really know.
That man is your father.
What does he say to do?
Yeah.
Okay.
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
He isn't?
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I know.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
Take plenty of cigars.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
Meaning?
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
Or get eaten alive.
Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
No.
You mean I'm black?
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
Big threat. TV would ream you.
Yeah.
No, I don't.
Pull out your cock.
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
Just one.
The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.
That's Charity. She's out back. She'll be free in half hour.
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
The other girl is the star?
Where's he?
Huh?
I don't drink, but you can go out.
No.
Yeah.  I'm her father.
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
Fuck.
Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers don't mess around.
They are the same.
But what?
...What do you have to offer?
You are.
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
What do you mean?
The police? They know less than you do.
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy.  A lot of strange things happen in this world. Things you don't know about in Grand Rapids. Things you don't want to know about. Doors that should never be opened. I've known more about this sort of thing than a man should. Don't ask me why.
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
But this is my apartment.
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
It's just a name.
But I'm here to help you...
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
What is going on?
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
Take it or leave it.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
In other words, you want to get laid?
It's an investment.
If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
What do you think of that? Or this?
You never heard of that?
Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
Huh?
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.
Yes.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Then whose name is it registered in?
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
Promise?
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my "Odorifics."
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
You don't look eighty.
Well...
What?
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
Why not?
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
You are the wisest person I know.
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
Do you think there is any life up there?
I don't know. Perhaps.
Yes.
For you.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...
Perhaps it is.
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Yes. It does.
Ah, yes.
Would you care to talk about this friend?
Yes.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
Then why are you here?
Nonsense, I...
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
-- Hound of resurrection?
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
Oh, I'll bet you have.
No. It's not.
No. It was red. Bright red.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
Hostage negotiations.
Goodnight.
Yes, I --
Just take it slowly.
Stay the fuck away from me.
Oh Christ.
Kirsty?
No.
This isn't happening.
I came for the wedding.
Oh.  Oh yes.
Well can I come in or not?
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back...
Tell me, damn you.
You promised me an explanation.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
I said no.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Of course. There's no need to shout.
Ah!
It's just been empty a while.
In here.
We'll move in Sunday.
Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
Are you O.K.?
Sure.
Drinking alone.
Not much.
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
I found a room.
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
I love you too.
Really?
What?
I don't believe it.
No you don't.
I have to get out.
That's right. Cointreau.
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
Your father told me you were working here.
No, it's good to see you.
What did he ever do to you?
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," what would you think?
How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
Suck my ass.
What band?
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
No, you can't.
A couple blocks!  About six!
Oh.  Okay.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
Nice friend.
Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
I'll tape it for you.
I understand, Dick.
-- FUCK OFF!
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
Who's that?
Yeah.
Well stay for tonight, then.
Hi.
You really believe that?
And do you like it that way?
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
Fine.  One.
Is what better?  Better than what?
Will you please just go?
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I guess.
No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.
Is that the last of it?
You still together?  Going all right?
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed.
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
What it was like.
Oh, great...
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
You're tougher.
Harder.
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
I'm going to talk to you.
I know.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
Are you persuadable?
What's happenin'.
How're you holding up?
It's a crematorium.
Yup.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
So you'll stay?
I'll call you.
Right.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Seventy-five.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
Claymore.
Happy birthday.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
No.
Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
Yes.
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
No.  I had to talk to you.
You are.  Now.
Yes.
I see.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
Just a little crazy.
I'd like you to try.
Of bodies.
You killed those other two.
Not the same.
I haven't killed _you_.
Come here, Brenna.
Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
We've got nothing to say.
It'll never stick.
All I need is for you to check the name.
How can you know this?
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
It is less.
I don't understand.
Not even a single lifetime.
You will live.  Survive.
That is not me.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Do what you must.
Something pretty.
Not likely.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
He's a MacLeod.
Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
What name is he using?
And the Bulgarian?
Kahn?
How did you find me?
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
He always did.
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
Where were you Tuesday night?
I'm sure that's true.
Hildy!
Well, congratulations! Good luck!
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Did you give her the money?

Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
No. My mother.
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
That's the kind of stuff they want!
Say, I want to be sure, too!
What do you mean by that?
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Better.
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
I'd like to think.
All right, Walter.
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
What happened?
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
What would you do if it was a daughter?
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
Walter, you can't do that!
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
What's that -- what's that?
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Beats king up.
Little rum in yours, too?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
Yeah. But I --
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
A sight for sore eyes!
I can't.
Five hundred dollars.
Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Isn't that her picture?
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Well, maybe you think I could!
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
But how do I know...?
You're insane!
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
I concede I was insistent, but how the Devil...
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
They're not.
Do you know any swear words?
I'm starting my own collection.
Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
Please yourself.
....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
What's that?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
Grace!
That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
OK.
Is your brother ready to go?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
Fucking great.
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
Great story Goober, how much?
Yeah, no shit.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
I gotta open the gate.
Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement. He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
So what?
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
I still don't.
Not yet.
Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds.
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
Fit the profile?
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
Call the chief... We found 'em.
Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
You remind me so much of Nathan.
That would be good.
Yes. Happy happy.
Shh.
Hmmmph.
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
Very well.
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
God, you're beautiful.
I've moved on.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
That's what I'm counting on.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Shut up and tell me.
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
Oh?
Three foot one.
Stand on a stepladder sometimes.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Nathan told my brother.
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
I'm sorry?
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
No biggie.
Yes, and...
You do?
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
Yes.
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
That's very funny.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
I think he's feral.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
Of course not.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
I'll make it.  I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right?  Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink.  Voila!
I had sold my fucking soul.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Packard. Sarah Packard.
Lots of action. Lots of money.  Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out.
Well, nobody has to sell.
You tell me.
That's the way it's done.
All I want's the money.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
Two.
Pool.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
Whaddya been so far?
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
To do what?
You know everybody, don't you?
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
I'm a businessman, kid.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
Who's he?
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
Nobody can make that shot and you know it. Not even a lucky lush.
Ten grand! I mean, what other poolroom is there in the country where a guy can walk out with ten grand in one night? Jeez, you know, I can remember hustling an old man for a dime a game.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Give me a drink, will ya?
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
Yeah, that's what I think.
Glad to meet you.
By all means.
Oh no, nothing for me.
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
Okay, friend. You're on.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Can I buy you another drink?
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
Why?
Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
Why did he tell you?
Is that what makes a winner?
You need the words?
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
Big John! You think this boy is a hustler?
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
Preach... get it at Johnny's.  You got a bet.
I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
You lived like this once.
Do you want to go on?
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
My wife.
I only protect myself -- !
What do you mean?
Round back.
You'll meet new friends.  I know ... it's rough.  But I have to move, son.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
Because the sky is so clear out here.
There's Cassius ...
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
I was so scared.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
We were having a little talk.
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
Can you tell me about that?
I don't see anything.
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
I know a way.
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
What kind, Mom?
They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
Why, yes.
Cool.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
I take it you've heard.
If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
Did it work?
Think nothing of it, Spanky.
So sue me.
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
You punched the President in the face?
I'm making a mess.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
I had a feeling you would.
Then God help us.
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
He's my angel.
I'm a dancer.
But, Mr. President...
I said call them back.
Yes.
Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me.
People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
What do you want us to do?
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
What is it?
Do you believe, Marcus?
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
No?
No. You like the way I do things.
How do you know?
My father didn't want it incinerated.
You do.
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
If only I could have been with you.
Umh?
She talks in her sleep.
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
Try and burn through the ropes.
...the solution presents itself.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
What final challenge?
The penitent man. The penitent...
Penitent. Penitent...
"J".
We named the dog Indiana.
Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.
But, Indy --
Where's my father?
Then we'll die.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
There are no stories anymore.
Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.
Nee chin lie how ma?
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
That's it. Pankot Palace.
What evil?
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
What do you mean -- how?
The old man saw it in a dream.
It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
You're talking to an authority in that area.
Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!
Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
I am -- it looks horrible!
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
Don't do that.
Me.
Who?
I told you, my name is Al.
That a new Datsun?
I don't know what you're talking about.
No.
Loading a gun.
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
I'm not leaving until you do.
We have to get out of here.
Door's locked.
With Authority!
Corridor A.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
Gone where?
Send a man there. A secret agent.
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
We get on a plane.
I don't have any.
We'll change your appearance.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
Just get there.
What was?
What's happening?
Try another language.
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
Doesn't.
The beautiful one.
Don't get too cute.
Not her. You!
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
Oh come on.
Shit! You're in love.
I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
You found her.
Better. I found Ryuji.
Fountainhead of High-Tech.
I can't keep up.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
Too late.
You have to! Quickly!
I can't see a thing.
You were with GRUNER!
I don't trust her.
Not sure at all.
While he makes the run.
I don't know.
Keep thinking.
You've changed your mind.
It's all we've got.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
What part what?
I insist.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
She found out what she could ...and delivered him here.
**?!! 
We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
Sir?
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
He's not an ordinary man.
That name's familiar.
I think I've heard of you.
When you do...
Well...
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
I feel fine.
You'll feel better
Couldn't help it. No offense. She's not your wife is she...?
Then who did?
No. No one to speak of.
Do what?
...and sort of...disinterest.
Disinterest?
Are you alright?
You talk to yourself.
And how'm I doing?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
And you, what do you like?
Why'd you run off?
They left. I had to go with them.
Why?
Who else is interested in me?
They kidded me a little.
There's not much to tell.
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
No, he didn't do that.
This business is over.
What's he done?
Get your things.
You think I'm like that?
You coming along?
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
We're not moving fast enough for him.
Too much.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Instant rice...?
What's that outside, Daddy?
That remote control thing?
There's Dad, on TV.
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
We gotta hook up.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier...  Push the deadline, Charlie...
The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic." It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower."
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
I'm not touching my film...
We're doing this with or without you, Lowell. If you like, I can assign another producer to edit your show...
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS.
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
You ready...?
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
Is there any more rice...?
That's my stuff from the office...
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
Can we talk about this when I get back?
I'm alone on this...
You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
Alright.
All right. See you...
Yeah.
Lowell.
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
I disappeared on you?
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
You okay?
It's obvious, isn't it?
It's okay.
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Did you have a good day?
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
She did not sue me. We had a dispute over money... I settled it, she dropped the complaint...  Any other questions?
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
Well, what do you really think, though?
There is -- there is no family.
Where you staying now?
Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
Most certainly.
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
When should we do this?
So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
Howard!
You did good, Massey!
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
I don't need it.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
It was a gift from a client.
Set one side for Bel Air.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
What is your husband's profession?
You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
She held that against you?
Your mother was.
Did you just propose to me?
Good.  Are those foods?
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
I have a surprise for you.
May I come in?
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
Marylin!
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Jesus.
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
Shit.
But you're going through with it?
Well, that's about to change big time.
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
Video.
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
Video.
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
HA!
-- the coin?
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
Why—uh—she's all right, sir.
Yeah.
What ten thousand?
You're a peculiar chap.
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because—
I'll get it annulled.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
I knocked several times.
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Oh, yes. I heard.
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you—made your life so miserable—and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
Is that his name?
Oh, no—no.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Driver!
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
I don't want it reported!
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Oh, yeah? It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm, but I'm going to follow you, see?  Yeah. And if you get tough I'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy?  Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. Now if you behave yourself, I'll see that you get to King Westley; if not, I'll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right.
Oh, this?—I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
Not at all. 
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Like this. I have no robe.
Nope. No complaints.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
I thought maybe—uh—"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Thanks, professor.
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
Aren't you afraid of me?
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
You're prejudiced.
Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instance—a natural "piggy-backer."  Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family?  Why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that he—
I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Thought you were hungry!
No. But I've got a penknife. 
Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it—
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
Come on—get in.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
A black eye. 
Same to you.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of it—the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging. 
Husband?
Yes—if he is your husband.
Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything.  Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .
Just your imagination.
Yeah.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
Collect?
Oh!!
Zeke.  Git!
What's the idea?
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
Without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.  We got the same problem with the governors. All of them.  Reagan in California won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.
Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
This is Louisiana, chief.  How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one.  Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one of his best men.
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
Why?  What's wrong?
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
I want the truth.
I know.
It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
How many men?
The Warren Commission call him?
You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
Honey, another one of these.  This one's as weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Virginia.
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
Yes, Max, I understand.
Who?
That's why they call it "fuckin' with ya." Now you wanna hear how we retaliate?
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
She wants to go back to work.
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I'd love one, but not there.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
With ten thousand? Nine.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
Uh-huh.
The Delfonics.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
You're gonna offer to set him up?
How'd you feel about it?
Bigger?
Fifteen thousand.
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
That's my job.
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
Less ten percent.
Spain.
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
I know what it looks like.
She didn't say.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
Yes. All those things are true.
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
What did you do after that?
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
You'd take a polygraph on it?
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
What's that fucker ever done for us?
Thanks.
Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.
I was expecting you. Come in.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.
It's true, isn't it?
What did they say?
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
I can sit through it once.
Susanville.
Two months shy of four years.
Bank robbery.
Really, I'm impressed.
What's a Metrix?
It's a diet thing?
No thanks.
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
So where did you go?
C'mon, don't lie.
Did you ever go I one?
You lived in Japan, when?
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Does that bother you?
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
You sure?
Are you serious?
But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
You know how she is.
You couldn't just hit her?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
I think I do. Is that good enough?
Gonna have to put up cash.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
Now I need you to count your money.
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
It still sounds high.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
My office.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
I know where it is.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
I was gonna tell you...
Take me home.
No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain.  Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
I see.
Like Della.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
You're hurting me!
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
What are you talking about?
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Hey, wait!
Don't bother to call again, okay?
Now what?
How long had that been going on?
A couple of weeks, I think.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
How do you know?
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
I haven't seen her in months.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Yes.
I don't know what to say.
Jacob Singer.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
Who did?
No. Don't move me.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
What happened to you?
Don't ask.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
I don't let anybody call me that.
Yeah, but for what?
A good lay.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Not to me.
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
Come on. What were they, Jake?
How high is that?
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
Here. I'll do it.
I love you, Jez.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
How come? The army?
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
Me neither.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
I love you when you're angry.
Where are they?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
I don't know you.
Then don't bug me.
Sit down, Jake.
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
What's happening? Help me.
Better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
No. I couldn't.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
I don't know what to say.
I no from around here.
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Count 'em on one hand.
Nope.
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
You've seen them?
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
He doesn't like it.
Speaking of which, duck!
We're not leaving Crutch!
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
I think I broke my arm.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
You just keep an eye out.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
You?
Oh sure, all the time.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
Did you like it?
Old woman?
I get it.
We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
Would you?
Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!
In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Defense droids. I'm on it.
No! He's coming with us!
I just know.
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
Old Earth?
Exactly.
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
My boat's neat, dad!
You got it.
The bilge pumps. There --
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
Thank you.
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
So we should set out a smorgasbord?
I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
Swell.
Let's all have a drink.
Rogue?
What? What?!
Chum?
Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him.  It's a good time, too. They're night feeders...
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
They must've hit something.
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
No shark did that to a boat!
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
I can't stand here doing nothing!
Think the tide's with us?
I can't imagine why.
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
Twenty years.
So would I. Come on in.
You're leaving?
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
Well, I do.
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Yup.
Yup.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
Oh, go fly a kite.
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know...
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
I wrote that.
Junk?
We definitely want it to have junk.
Here's to dovetailing interests.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
You're something else.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Nope. We're safe.
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes!
Really? Fingernails?
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Elbow.
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
Well, it's not. You're not a lion in a pride!  These kids, acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights.
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
They're yellow.
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
What?
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
Carrie.
...Thank you.
...Yeah.
That's not true!
Vernon, Florida.
Who?
...Ha.
Hell it don't...  ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. One day I'm gonna pass some store and see your book in the window. Me and Adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table.
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
A... I gotta go.
...I do.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Carrie.
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!
What are you going to do?
No.
...That'd be my guess.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Were they wearing condoms?
Yes!
You're clean.
You fucked it?
She can fuck?
Yeah.
To what? Virgins?
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
He lives on 76th?
It's no big deal, right?
Yep.
Right.
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
Yeah.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Yeah probably.
Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles.
Nothen' B.
Where you at?
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Is it cold?
I just know. I know you'll love it.
What do I want to do?
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
Why is that?
What?
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
You still mad at him?
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
I gotta find him.
Making love is like.
Sweet.
Yeah.
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
Yeah.
Oh god. That's horrible.
All right.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
It's very monotonous.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
OK.
You are!  I don't like you.
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
It's all a big game isn't it?  A sick, fuckin' game.  I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out.  Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.  It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
Local?
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
What was suspicious about him?
Why did you write remember on the wall?
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
The pipes.
You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
Fuck off!
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
Nothing.
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
How long she been dead?
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
What does that mean?
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
This is insane!  Can't you see what's going on.  The killer wants me out of the way.  He's setting me up.
Who says something's on my mind.
Yes.
It seems like such a complicated game.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
This isn't a game.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
Of course.
Do you?
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
Of course.
Why?
Because I work with them.
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
What is this?
What?  By attacking me?
Does anyone?
--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
He didn't tell you either.
Me too.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
I won't leave you here.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
Never.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
The Beast will kill her.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
I don't think that.
You will not, then?
I have need of friends.
That I promise you.
I'm all right.
Not sleepy, either?
We must try to get horses.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
A small house.
Sugarballs?
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
Hush!
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
You had a son.
Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
Yeah.
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!
How can you say it?
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
Mathilda, stop, please!
What?
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death.  For the moment, I have none of the two!
I love you so much, Leon.
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
...I don't know.
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
...I got lost, Mister.
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Emilio? Due grappe!  ...Why the hell did you come here?
No... Dino's.
I have new dreams now.
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
Maybe later.
You should definitely have children.  They're really special.
Thank you.
Don't wait by the phone.  If he's really been walking this whole time, he's out of our jurisdiction...
That's enough.
Yes.
Not our problem.
If he is, half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jack-asses.
Who's telling this story?
Walking where?
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
What, come on?
It's mine to risk.
In a hospital.
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
Good morning.
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
Yes.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Coffee?
No.
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
It's me, Yuri.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
Get up.
Who?
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Yes. I was washing my hair.
Where you got in the shower.
Yes.
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
He chose them already?
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
What'd you do?
Relation?
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
Your scrunchie?
My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish.
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
Margot!
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Aside from that.
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
You're serious?
I don't --  Do that stuff.
Are you asking me on a date?
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
Absolutely!
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
I don't know --
You should. Do you have a resume?
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
Then what? My boobs are too big?
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
East coast people are different.
You go where?
What, like it's that hard?
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
I gave her my word, Warner.
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
You're right. Phew!
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
Not from me, surely...
And you... are you not also afraid?
Don't please... I'll do what you desire...
And then?
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
There's a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it... and a silver key no lock can resist.
Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
No... I... I need to rest.
I meant no disrespect.
Mayhap you be the one what's lost, and she safe by the castle hearth... but, come Jack, we'll warm your bones.
What does she want from me?
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
Don't you know?
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
What know you of fields of war?
Ofttimes, the wee folk come out to tend the wounded... staunch bleeding with cobwebs... give a parched mouth a sip of dew... cool a fevered brow...
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
There's the way, mates.
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
Nay.  This time we strike first!
The chill is worse this night.
What magic have we on our side?
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
He'll not escape me.
You're on your own... like a true champion.
By the pond.  She was teasing me.
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow...
If you like.
Be patient.
They rival the angels of paradise.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
Who?
I don't want it on me.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
Oh, la...
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
Everywhere!  Ow!
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
She's dead!
Dead, dead, dead.
You'll visit again?
No fear of that now.
In every way.
And am I not fair?
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
Oh, but I have.
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
Nay.  Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
We can work.
Sam!
I would have anyway.
Who are you?
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
You're a good girl.
I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
He jumped into the ocean.
Tell him I said "hi".
You look better without make-up.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
He's at work while I'm here.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
It could have been a squirt gun.
We've known each other since grade school.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
To the patio and one north-facing window...  And six inches to the height.
Pardon me?
how much weight have you lost?
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
I'm not.
That's too long.
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
Well, I feel better about this now.
Uh huh.
Not a shower.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
And you thought they might be under her dress?
Mom...please.
Your brothers are right.  It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
Hey...hey!
You're too fucking late.
The gloves on the table are for you.
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
I'm not even listening.
I know.  Why?
I know parts of who you are.
What do you know about me?
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
Why wouldn't she leave?
She seemed upset.
What's wrong with your back?
Are you taking them still?
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
I haven't been touched in years.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
I don't let him.  He just loves to.
You let him pierce his nose?
He doesn't answer.
A blueprint spool.
What did you do with your dog?
Not for the weekend.  For the summer.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
I don't have a phone.
I can't leave the house?
What?
The first and the last.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
Do you remember?
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
This was my very first slow dance.
What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
Going on?
That was the truth.
I didn't think you'd come today.
Peter left me yesterday.
What?
It's not my back that's killing me.
Does Alyssa know?
Don't even...I'm there.
I wasn't sure.
What are you doing home?
Please don't leave me.
Why?
I don't know what I'm doing.
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
Nagger?
Is Mae Rose okay?
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
Well you can't stay here, Biscuit. This ain't no life for a man. Any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes. I sure know I would.
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
But I'm having a good time...
That's because I've never been here before.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Claude Banks.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
You need collateral.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
What'd you say?
So you made a generous contribution.
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit.  How 'bout him down there?
Forget it.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
I'm sure it don't.
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Say what?
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
What am I gonna eat?
Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
Then I have nothing left to say to you.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
It's too late for plans.
You ever done time before?
How about some steak sauce?
Movin' it out, boss.
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
Don't worry about that. Hey, fellas, this here is my mama. These are some of my friends. That's Willie, there's Poker Face, Radio, Cookie, Goldmouth, Biscuit, Jangle Leg.
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
It'll be too late.
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
You shouldn't have come here.
I hear a train coming. Drink.
Is this a joke?
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
You're already there...
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
Son, just do your best.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Coulda been much worse.
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
See ya, fellas.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
Why are you laughing?
If you want to.
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
I'm fine...  See you...
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
Yes. Oh yes.  He was after you. I remember. You're running!
Yes... probably he was renewed?
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
And now?
A Runner gave it to me.
I let him go... believe me.
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
I have.
He's good, isn't he?
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
Ycch.  To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Things change!
It's all right with me. Is he here?
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Yes...
How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
Right... This just glided along.
Ours, Ed.
Over there.
Me, too.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
Yeah. Call him.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Alice, I...
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Sit down.
Out in back.
No... Here he comes.
What's the word on the street?
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
Nothin'.
I... I didn't say anything...
The first night... Not the last two.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
A videotape.
Does it say anything on the tape?
Called? When?
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
I wish I knew.
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
Pornos?
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Fossils.
Fossils, huh?
I'm a paleontologist.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
Good morning—
I see.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
Yes.
Just call me Barney.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
Huh?
Gold. You were going to—
Thank you.
So there are others?
In time you will meet them all.
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
No.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"—  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Oh, immediately.
Pardon me—
How can we get in touch with them?
In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now—
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Oh, the girl at the piano?
Mine?
Come on! Quick! This way.
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
Nothing about the porters yet?
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
Chang! Chang! Chang!
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
Yes, everything!
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.
My name's Sondra.
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
Thank you.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
I was just going to.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
It's not even a fucking door.
No. just peace on Earth.
We're the government, Cowan.
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
Actually, it didn't come from me.
I'd go with number three.
Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?
Sir--
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
Ha ha.  No, really.
And what's this ... ?
What?
Where to?
Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
For how long?
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up.
They're not my pals--
What if I don't?
I wanna make a deal.
May I have a look?
Come again?
They went right to the President.
They haven't announced it yet.  All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.
Did it leave?
He won't.
Wait.
Please --
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
Yeah --
The nano... what?
No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here, but...  ... I can't pull up any data from the female.  Probably just a glitch.
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
In the middle of the night?
I'm fine, Lamar.
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Go back to work.  All of you.
Flaws.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
Oh... Hi, John.
I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
Oh, Sean --
Good-bye, Dad...
He's alive?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
And how would I know that?
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
Do you?  Really?
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
You're insane or you think I am.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
He's dead, Lara.
Oh, God, what did you do?
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
No.  He can't...
How many?
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
Sure.  Raincheck.
That was our apartment.
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
But there's still the other two.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
When served warm --
We're in Fashion.
Somebody's getting comfortable.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
I want spaghettis.
I don't know.
Oh, please.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
I want you to quit.
Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
Goodbye, Bobby.
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
What's his name?
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
What's that?
Where is this happening?
Where's Ricky?
That it?
Why?
This one?
What?
I don't understand.
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
So?
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
You wanna go right now?
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
It's not even yours.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
Nah, don't bother --
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
I mean, that's what I heard --
You got something to say --
I don't know.
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
We're not getting whacked.
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
I'm pretty sure we do.
Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
Easy...
I didn't do anything --
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
You're up front. Everything's free up here.
'Strapped?'
Why? What I say bad?
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Yeah.
You know my pager number?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
Different.
We're going to New York?
That money is your per diem.
But, Max --
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
Let 'em come. I'm ready.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you.
What did you give it to me for then?
Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at?
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue- eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
I don't know what to say to Allah.
I want to. God knows I want to.
If you want to tell me.
How do you like it?
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
What do you think?
I just want to sit here and be still.
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
Dear heart, I love you.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
I assumed...
You put it very well.
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
Allah Akbar.
Sure, man.
Murder.
Your control over your children, therefore --
What mission?
What does Sidney say?
...That isn't a whore?
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
What can you do?
Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
No.
Am I a suspect?
[South America.]
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[Who's the boss?]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
How long you staying, Crease?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
Yes.
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
Your father has business.
You don't drink like you used to.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Then be trained.
Dyslexic?
You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
Last night. Do you know something?
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
Our daughter.
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
You helped him get this job.
I can take care of myself.
A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece.
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
What?
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
What for?
Who told you that?
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
I feel fine.
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
When was this?
Your son Marty?
That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
I'm having a very good time, too.
I'm thirty-four.
I really should get home...
Come on inna dining room.
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
Well, siddown a minute. I just come inna house. I'll take off my coat. Siddown a minute.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
You can't just walk off onna girl like that.
Sure, great if you ain't married.
You gonna get married.
Waddaya read there, Joe?
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
This is a good deal here, Marty.
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
Okay.
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
Look at that right eye.
Wisconsin.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
Duke Forrest.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
Call Dago Red.
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
You betcher ass, Dad.
What?
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
I don't get it.
He can move in here with us.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
You're an attractive man.
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Why would he do that?
They missed the boat.
Thanks.
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
Let's get his clothes off quick.
You guys got any black capsules?
You can cut the bow.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
Yes, dammit, and...
I can try, sir.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
Huh?
There is no letter.
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Has he been here?
Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
A what?
Sure, you are.
Yeh.
John Doe Club?
And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
Huh? Get what?
Well, I'm stuck with two and two—but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appear—and in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people—
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
Thanks.
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
No, sir.
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
Of course.
Clarence Teal.
Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
Is that where you're family lives?
You want a convertible or hardtop?
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
No. You just do shit for me right now.
Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
I'm ready to do it.  And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.
How do you feel after a shooting.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
Is there something wrong with that?
You have to. It's a tradition.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
It'll come. Try again.
I'm not good at lying.
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.  Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side...
You're a compulsive gambler?
I have two words for you... Seek help.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
The jockey!
He's cutting down the visibility.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
And what about the ones you don't save?
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
My name's Scott Roper.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Just now.
Use your imagination.
Scottie...
Do it!
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
What?
Are you going to make this hard for me?
-- You've made your point!  You've got control of the system.
To live forever.
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
Why --
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?
Nothing, go back to sleep.
In a computer program.
Take care?  Where the hell are you going --
-- He won't.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
He wouldn't say.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
The truth.
Then where is she?
Come on Tanner, think this through.
Some things never change, do they?
Her?
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Why not?
-- Waiter.
Resurrection.
How can we reach Phaedos?
Now tell me... what do you see?
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
Where did it originate?
In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies.  For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.
I think so.
We can take these guys!
THERE'S THE COMET!
A real shame.
You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
And I ain't no nigger either!
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
What are ya tellin' me, Charlie?
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
Awwh, Charlie.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
Life knocked me back.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
If we have to.
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
Which is why he doesn't need us.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
I must be going.
I was calling yesterday.
Guess I'm too confused to think.
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
See if these two are my friends.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
You gotta plan these things.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
The terms will be mine.
We were overdue to get hit.
The Big Picture.
I think these rich shits -- no offense Bobby -- are so dead below the waist that they gotta ride around all day swingin' at each other ta get their broads hot.
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
Luciano is dead?
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
This is nice. I mean it.
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Stu Miley.
Sad commentary, huh?
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
A piñata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Monkeybone...!?
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
<i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
You know ...  ... whoops!
You know, you never tell me anything.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
Yeah.  Not far.  You will be fine.  It's still day.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
Would you settle for a husband?
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
Oh--yeah--
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
No.
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
No--not offhand--
Susan? Nah!
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
Horace Mill--!
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Emma! Will you *please*--?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
Just a minute, I better make sure.
For a question!
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Will he *yield*?
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
Certainly would, Joseph.
How's Amos, Ma?
Convene?
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
I mean--gosh--I wouldn't be comfortable in a--I--I haven't got clothes and things like that--and--I couldn't keep pigeons *there*--No--I-- I just--just wouldn't be--
Punch?
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Oh, but this one is so simple.
A *day*!
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
Calendar?
*This* is.
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
Since sixteen or so.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
No complaints.
Have I?
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Letitia.
No! Stop it!
Great.
Second drawer.
And how's your bill, Senator?
How's that, buddy?
Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
Let's get away from here. 
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
You're the best nurse I can think of--
Nice *compliment*!
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
Well--me, too!
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
What do you think?
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
Jim, I won't stand for it.
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
Do I actually *see* this--?
Yes.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Uh-huh.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
Yes!
NO!!
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
What?
Really?
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Do you always wear your hair like that?
Yes.
Why don't you try?
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
I'll get my hat.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Thank you.
Let's just walk, okay?
All right.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
Hello.
With pay!  She is out the door.
Hurry up!
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Shhh!
Yes, sir.
Me, sir?
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Perfect! Perfect!
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
Wants to know who the heir is.
Where?
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N—
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie—
How do you do.
Are your parents living?
Who - me? No.
What for?
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
No, thanks.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Huh?
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Entertainment?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Why, it's an artistic institution—
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
Well, thanks, I - uh—  How do you do? What is your name?
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
Yes?
Not at all.
Proceed.
Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
Now you keep out of this!
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Every man to his taste, sir.
You're Walter, aren't you?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Prairie? Oysters?
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
Yeah.
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
Why are they ganging up against me?
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
Really? You think so?
Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
Doubtful. What did he say?
Mr. Cook.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
What's that?
No. It's sort of spur of the moment.
Not any more.
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
Why not?
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
Good, then go.
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
Should I open it now?
What exactly is it supposed to do?
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Nope.
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
Yes.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
What?
It was Henry Follett.
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Lily.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
I just got my license two weeks ago.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Oh... not a real doctor.
No, I really don't.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
Even if you don't think it's real?
It doesn't matter. Go on.
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
Disgusting.
And he's where?
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
Either one.
That's... good?
You're upset.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
In maybe three or four issues.
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
It's my bit for the community.
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.
What happened today?
What are you talking about?
What'd he say?
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.
I guess that makes sense.
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
Relax, I got him.
Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
Even?
Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
Yeah! Them.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
Two hundred pounds.
Fifty percent.
Twenty.
What are you doing here?
Broad?!
No, I mean --
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
And what is that?
I'm not?
Not unless you call me Rick.
Because that's my name.
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
FINE.
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
Right now, I only wish to join them.
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
Way to go, Evy.
Still...
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
Got it.
Don't worry, Pootchkie. My womanizing days are over. You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole.  We're such an incredible team. Who could possibly stop us? 
Fantasizing... about you.
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
Or even what it looks like.
You're nuts.
Are you with me... or against me?
Against.
Frankenstein!
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Sure -- I guess.
Why not?
Roy.
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
Monica, where are you?
I'm going inside.
When are you going to take off that mask?
Good point.
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
I'll drive.
I can't.
Anybody got any?
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
I use it... to fight evil.
It is?
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
Right.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
I am at your disposal, Your Majesty.
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
May I come to the map?
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
Cavalry?
There are none here.
I'm not insulted.
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
My God, what a fire!
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected.  How do you expect me to find yours?
I see.
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
Lisette La Croix.
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
Ah, that is good.
No.
What are you doing in there?
In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
Certainly.
That's all I can say.
Yes.
Yes, I wrote it.
You wrote it.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, then you are...
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
That is correct.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
Alright, I'll remember that.
Yes you did.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
Naw, I already ate.
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
I didn't see nothing.
Naw, you go first.
Wait for what?
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
Yes I did.  Excuse me.
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
I don't have no damn cover.
Negative...they vamped.
Let it go!
Thanks for the help.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
What?!
I know.  I'm sorry.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
Get on!
What?
Don't get it twisted, Elroy.  I ain't lost none of my street skills.
What's the matter?
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
Elroy.
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
You just come in on Amtrack?
Business or pleasure?
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
What?
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
Same to you.
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
What about the gun?
You fucked up.
Even if you don't, Her Security men will.
No.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
You know what I'm gonna do.
No, that's,..that's fine
Nods.
I promise.
I said I have to do something.
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
Don't think I won't.
What!?
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
I think this is worth a dollar.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
Go ahead, sugar Die.
'Daddy has to go now.
Just put her on.
Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
There! What's so hard about that!
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
I'll make coffee.
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
It -- she --
What's that you're playing with, boy?
The summer is young yet, little lad.  Pearl?
Don't you believe me?
You could save him, little bird.
Yes?
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
All right.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
I think it's time we got one thing perfectly clear, Willa. Marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of Heaven.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
It's about that John and that Pearl?
She took them kids with her?
Them kids!
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
You'll whip me!
The Drugstore?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
Jesus.
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Used to. Not anymore.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
And you'll be here to catch him, right?
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
It wasn't that serious...
I won't.
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
So he's alive?
How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
Of course. What's that?
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
Naturally, Comrade.
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
And there?
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Café de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
That's right.
I must be stern with you.
Shall we tell her?
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
Comrade Kopalski...
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
Brave... that's right.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
Look for yourselves.
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon...
We did our best, Comrade.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
Don't hold that against me... please!
What business?
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
I must get into that country of yours!
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
You're going to force us... huh?
At what intervals does he whistle?
Yes, it is.
Yes.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
He takes good care of that.
The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.
Is that customary?
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
No, that was restful. Again.
Let's forget that we ever met.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
I don't like your following me.
Then how did you get here?
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
What?
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
Because we are an odd couple.
Probably not.
Do you like Scotch stories?
I wish they had never met.
So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!
No.
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
You must, darling.
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
No speech?
No! No!
...and we won't clench our fist...
Let's turn on the radio.
Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
No thanks, Swana.
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
All right, I'll listen.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
Where are they?
Unfortunately.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
This will do. 
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
I understand that, sir.
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance.
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
My point exactly!  Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything.  Do you see me screwing everything that moves?  For Christ's sake!  I did what the New York Times editorial page said we should do!  I ended the war, I got SALT I with the Russians, I opened China!  So why are these cocksuckers turning on me?  Because they don't like the way I look.  Where I went to school.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
These State Department jerks, Bill, don't understand; you got to electrify people with bold moves.  Bold moves make history, like Teddy Roosevelt -- "T.R." -- rushing up San Juan Hill.  Small event but dramatic.  People took notice.
For what?!
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
That's right ...
Because the President says it is.  My job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls.
The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
I believe you're right, boss.
Why would they?!  Who the hell's Sulzberger anyway?  Their parents are gold traders from Eastern Europe. They buy things.  They come to Jew York City and they buy up things.  One of the things they buy is the New York Times.  And you know what?  Be proud because they'll never trust you, sir, because we speak for the average American.
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
No ...
My friends call me "Mister President."
I don't think we can treat this as a formality.  Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba.  But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
How about you?  Are you going to win?
It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
There's no other choice.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
We have to entertain the possibility ...
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
Are you serious?
You don't have to go.
Will you ... would you kiss me?
I've missed you.
You've been drinking.  What the hell are you saying?  Jesus, you sound like them now! ...  I've gotta keep fighting, Buddy, for the country.  These people running things, the elite ... they're soft, chickenshit faggots!  They don't have the long-term vision anymore.  They just want to cover their asses or meet girls or tear each other down.  Oh, God, this country's in deep trouble, Buddy ... and I have to see this through.  Mother would've wanted no less of me ... I'm sorry, Buddy.
Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Lost.
What?
"Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
Who else'd be in your truck.
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
I am older.
Yes I do.
Most don't.
Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
That don't hardly say it. He shoots the desk clerk one day, and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel.
Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
You ain't heard from him?
Would you tell me if you had?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.
That's very linear Sheriff.
Uh-huh.
Believe you're right.
That from the lock?
Yes sir.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
Yessir. It was punched out.
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
Yes Sheriff.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
I mean, would you care to join me.
Well I didn't see it.
You gave your word?
Yes. Things fall into place.
Llewelyn!
What're you doin', baby?
Well -- how come?
Uh-huh.
You should be used to that.
Not a bleep.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
All right.
No. Do you?
Didn't mean nothin'.
I guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things.
You already asked me that.
Sir?
Yes I do.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
Call it?
They'll give you a wallop.
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
You seem pretty sure of yourself. You've led something of a charmed life haven't you Mr. Wells?
Yes?
Can I get my parking ticket validated?
I'm sorry.
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
What outfit.
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
It wasn't a woman.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Anyway, so what?
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
I'm sorry.
This is really awkward...
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Well, you are.
You never gave us a chance...
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
Yes, she is.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
I have... did it sound that bad?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
Uh-huh.
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
You're in serious danger!
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
You're hurting him!!
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Fine.
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
No, almost never.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
More than you know. Is there anything else?
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
If we're for real?
Of what?
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
I hope you're right...
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
It just didn't fit her profile...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
What do you mean?
Hmm... you two in high school together?
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Better.
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
Did Chloe crack?
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the...
Everett, my beard itches.
Helluva awgazation.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Pullin' ah pants down...
Vernon T. Waldrip.
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
Yes, but honey -
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!
You didn't know that at the time!
Million point two.
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated.
He ain't our daddy!
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
Neither have you, pard!
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
I joined the Navy.
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
You got it, Sweet Pea.  Nice boonies, Seeger.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
I want to fly jets, sir!
Pity you don't have the character.
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
It's important, sir!
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
Pardon?
No, sir.
Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're giving me a hard on!
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
One more minute.
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.
Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
I know that.
So?
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Why?
I bet you do!
A little.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
But she expects you to marry her?
Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
This was your department, Junior.
So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
Shut up.
I did.
Jesus, what was I thinking?
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
I don't get it.
We'd like to come in.
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
Open it.
It's okay, Raoul.
What is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  You're a bus driver, "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so please don't start spouting some Elmore Leonard shit you just heard because I saw that movie too,
What?
Don't.
PANIC ROOM!
What do they want?
Wait.
Shaky?
Little bit.  Yeah.
YOU HAVE TO!
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
What if I do?
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
Fuck that, we've got company...
You know it brother.
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
Yeah... whatever you say.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Who's they?
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
I don't know. Except, it's one of you. Maybe not a Panther, but it's someone from the neighborhood. Judge. Look, just go. Get away. It's over. You lost.  We all lost.
Man, fuck you!!!
Inside ain't in the system.  It's right there inside you!! I'm joining up.
Naw... I gotta...
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
As far as Mr. Hoover is concerned the worst has happened, the Panthers have unified with other organizations -- most likely sponsored by communists -- to undermine the war in Vietnam.  By doing so, they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction.
We're working on that...
So talk...
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
Just a kid.
All of the above, man...  And then some.
What?
Why didn't you tell me?
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
Thank you.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
His journals, letters, maps, books...
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
He's my father.
As do you.
Yes, sir.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
As you wish.
Oh?
I will do so as soon as possible.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night.
Most certainly.  Arrange it.
Probably.
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence.
You're in no condition to ride.
I have no choice, I...
It's safer if we stay together.
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
Seven homes along the Black River so far...
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
How many men have we seen die?
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
And what is the second thing?
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
Yes--
Of course I will.
That's enough, Ellen.
Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
Yeah, sure.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
Yes.
But--
Yes, but--
Ayuh.
You're telling me.
Yes.
Well...a touch of the flu...
Leave me alone!
Did you see his shirt?
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
That boat is my livelihood!
Wait as long as you like.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
Would that I could.
Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
Yes -- yes.
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
You're in league with Barbossa!
You're right.  Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Yes, the rum is gone.
Exactly.
What's your plan?
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
Aye, that'll about do it.
That he is.
How did he get off the island?
Pirate.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
I swear, you look just like him.
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
Bleak.  Very bleak.
Speak.
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
Oh no.  You're not like me.  In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
No, Icky, this is real.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
I want Trix!  Mommy!
A man?
The replicators?
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
Am I?  Look!  Right there!  That's exactly what I am talking about.
Susan, this is the future of America here.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
Yes.
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
What do these replicators do to people?
Just giving credit where credit is due.
Something else I want to try.
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
And you have him?
We lost him.
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Stewart!
Why—
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
Mother!
Is that so?
Is that so?
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Come on, get going, get going!
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Now Mr. Smith, now please—
Outside!
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
Staring at us?
My mistake - she's glaring.
Hello, Hank. How are you?
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Conrad.
Right.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and—
You quit trying to stop anybody—
I suppose you know why I came—?
I don't eat waffles.
I beg your pardon.
Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys.
They've been ready for the last half hour.
I have. Double-strength!
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
Yes.
Looks just like it did.
I had to say goodbye.
Yes she is.
I don't know.
Yeah. It does.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
Sure you are.
... Lover's Lane.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
I said, NO!  ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ...
What?
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
The basketball team?
You're not allowed to lie.
Oh sure it is.
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Pleasantville Marathon?
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Owns the hardware store.
Play along?
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Can we do any better?
It's in your closet.
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Right here.
Oh ... Hi.
Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...
Yeah.
We'll just put up the top.
Right. And how did she dress him?
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you?  It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.
Oh.
Yeah ...
Yeah ...
... What's that?
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
Just a little--You know.
TV repair?
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Well it's just not true. We wouldn't be looking at you -- why are you wearing this suit? Did you say hello to your brother in law's?
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
Well I don't want to do something like that.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
That's your fault not mine.
I know.
I don't know.
Yeah I can't.
It's not mine.
I have no idea.
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
Nothing.
I'm in my bedroom.
Sure.
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
...yeah....well you have me now.
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
You have trouble, financial trouble?
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
No. I'm sorry.
You lied to me?
No you won't.
They're not open yet?
Do you know them.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
I think that'll be fine.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
Ok.
Do you want to pick me up?
....Hi.....
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
Nothing.
Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
Are you learning how to play it?
Yes? I'm trying.
Ok.
Ok.
Ok. Where are you from originally?
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
Yeah.
No.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
I didn't do it.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Yes it is.
Can I ask how much is this?
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
Thank you.
.....Well yes I do....  But one more thing I wanted to tell you guys about the new plungers is that we're making the handles now in a non-breakable material called.....
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
Yes I'm fine.
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
Hi, Lance.
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
Ok.
Hi.
What?
Wait a minute --
Yes.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
I know.
I'll see you there.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
I'll just see you when you get back here.
Now give the signal.
Yes, Abbe?
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
"Turn you out?"
You'll hate me now, won't you?
Mustn't do that, sir.
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
Don't be so sure.
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur.
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
That's enough.
THEN BUGGER ME!
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
-- that was lust --
Was it impotence?
Of course.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
And his writing?
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
Enough!
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the future.
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
Don't start --
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
Fiendishly so.
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
No. But tell him I would.
That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
-- words alone are insufficient.
Forgive me, I beg you --
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
Hope you don't mind my popping in--
Over at RKO?
Yeah
You know that can't happen.
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
Sir? 
We're using-
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
That's right
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Nonsense
Right-
The old man has his own way of doing things
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
We're doing Hearst.
Fuck you--
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
Craig is one syllable
But it's not a great syllable
Uh huh.
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Oh God.
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
To do what?
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
You're lying to me.
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
Then find another theater
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
You want to do the life of Jesus?
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
How can he embarrass you?
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
It's not done.
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
What did Tommy say?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
Where you been?
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
Whadda ya mean?
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
Nine o'clock.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
Yeah, I sucked his cock.
OK. Talk.
No, not that.
Then what?
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
Don't make no difference no more.
He should.
This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
And you're drinking with them right now.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
His wife took a trip.
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "Your request for transfer turned down --"
You sure it belongs to his wife?
That depends on who "they" were.
The police Department at Merritsville. They called to report. The trunk was just picked up -- by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
Like an old hambone?
With that cast on -- you don't.
You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Like what?
Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss.
Jeff --
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
Tell her to bring it back!
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Lisa Fremont.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
Depends one which one.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
You called the police?
Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend.  An old, ornery friend.
Look!
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
No.
Yes.
You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
Make the one you want.
Yes.
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Do you think I consider this recreation?
Don't you see how silly you're being?
What's the apartment house number?
125 West Ninth Street.
Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is, yet.
Don't rush me. We have all night.
A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
Huh?
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window. 
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Phone number?
Chelsea 2-5598.
They always live.
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
Know the Millertown bluff?
You clean out of your head?  Come on!
Hang loose.  We got all night.
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
What would you do, Dad?
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
I don't want to learn that!
You don't?
I think I know my son.
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
Where did you get the gun?
What's the charge?
You remember me?
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
Who knows.  Plato?
What's a chickie-run?
Who has?
It's me!
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Help me in!
I'm here.  Shut up.
Plato!
I've got a gun.
Here.
You trust me, don't you?  Just give it to me for a second.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
That's a fine way to behave!
All right, darling.
It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
I don't know why--!
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
Try the desk.
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
And your folks didn't understand?
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Yes, ma'am.
"Life is crushing in on me."
Won't mother be proud.
Oh.
I'm not so bad.
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
It doesn't matter to them.
No--I was just--maybe--
I'm numb.
Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What?  You still here?" Man!
You decide, darling.  Remember our budget.
Are you?
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
You smell like baby powder.
I never felt so clean before.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
Yes.  My best friend.
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
Hi.
Gabriel, let him go --
...whoever she is.
-- till he fucked his parole --
No, no --
One more. Smile. One more.
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
NICK!
Nick...
Nick, what are you --
No, Nick, no --
You're in on this.
...maybe I die for Nick...
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
What?
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
We'll need one.
They all are. Football's on.
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
You shouldn't have.
Who wouldn't.
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
And you think telling me that's gonna help your cause.
I never worked at no casino.
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
What'd they call her in high school?
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
I did.
Don't tip.
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
You need six.
Six men means six guns.
I'm no threat without a gun.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
Ash?
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
GUARD!!!
No, man! No, no, no!
And you set me up.
You gave them me.
Well...sorry...
Fine, now.
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
You ain't dying, he is.
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Yeah.
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
How is he?
It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin."
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
Sorry, it's my book now.
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.
I do.  How do I look?
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
No, I'm not!
Lie back down, and try to -
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
Why not?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
Where? Are they out in the car?
That was the plan, we meet here.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
Of course.
This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
Look of things, she doesn't.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
Go on, there's a good boy.
We can't stay here!
That's fine.
What does a man usually tell a girl?
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
Hurry up.
Maybe they will.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
Which ranch?
A little hot.
Nice.
Swimming.
Good thing you didn't.
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
I just wondered. Let's go.
Kind of sore.
What's botherin' you, anyway?
I'm sorry. Let's go.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
They shouldn't have done that.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Everybody knows --
Where is he?
Because there's a man I want to see.
He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
Good night, Steve.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Wife?!
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Psychology.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
What, you think I did this to myself?
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me.
Yes!!!!
My child, you're alive!
We? What do you mean... we?
Hey, I got an idea.
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
Professor!
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
The keys. She took the keys.
My help?
A little bit... Give me your belt.
Alright, go to the belt store...
No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.
What she said about your mother?
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie.
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
I certainly did not.
He certainly drives like a jerk.
But Mom, the video's not over.
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. 
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
Shhhh..
What a mess.
...People who don't mind their own business.
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!
We all have bad nights. 
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Yes... but... I didn't...
Certainly not!
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! 
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
No.
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
About forty-five dollars.
Hello, Frances.
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
Nothing.
He was a kind little man in his way —— and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
I'd like that.
We've tried so long to find her.
I know —— I shouldn't have told you—
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
I don't know.
No!
Why wait?
And then?
Yes.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
Who was the first one -- Mrs. Redi?
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
I've lost my knack.
You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is -— when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
A gay lot -— Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
Oh.
Well...
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
No.
Kids? What about them?
Impotent.
You are?
What?
My therapist said that --
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
Somehow I imagined books. I thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time.
Yes.
I know.
Why didn't you tell me?
What difference does it make why I do it?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Does he go down on you?
I guess not.
You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
Yes.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
I'm not planning on it.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
But you're planning to be?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
Because.
No.
I'm okay. It's okay.
Are you having an affair?
Is that supposed to comfort me?
Why?
Yes.
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
So it was recently that you tried this.
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
What do you mean, like physically?
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
Because I never got around to it.
No, but I did.
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
It does not.
Well. I can't stay.
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
So will you, someday.
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
Not exactly.
And you ask questions, right?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
Do I sit or stand?
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
He doesn't have to tell me.
No? Not even one more?
I can't talk you into it?
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
When?
That you... you don't even know the guy.
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
You have family here also?
No.
Shut up!!!
One moment.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Hi. Want a drink?
Was he nice to you?
You're the one who found the bodies?
He sounded fine.
No. I don't think so.
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Look. You got men, you got parasites that live in, on, and around men. Now. Why not breed a parasite that does something useful? Eh? Why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs? Why not, for example, a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney? If it takes a little blood for itself, so what? Be generous! You can afford it.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
Yes?
Lemme clarify for you.
Huh?
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
I tell you what's cooking.  She made the blind see and it was a gift!  Who was it from?  Let's hear an 'F" for...
Congratulations!  It's 'Happy Homes' for Harry and Emily Weiss of Denton.
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
Home?
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Sure thing.
Absolutely correct.
Could you tell us a little about it?
Who?
YOUNG BLOOD
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
Surely.
We're not confused.
We all love Janet...Who do we love?
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
Bye.
And?
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
Me too.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
Let me call Christine.
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
Now.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Whoa.
If that's what feels right.
Then it's a good thing.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
What?
Nah. I want to watch this.
Aye-aye, captain.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Okay! Fuck!
We were supposed to play golf.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
Okay! Jesus!
Yep.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What the fuck are you doing?
With this chick.
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
Been checking your messages?
Huh.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
All I know is she's beautiful. Lots of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up. Don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your Johnson?
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
You have to tell me --
I SAID OKAY?
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
Hold on.
Back at you.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
I finished it.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Yeah. Definitely.
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
Got it.
Okay.
Miles?
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
You golf?
This one?
That's weird.
Who said I was going to die?
Me too.
You love walks.
I'm here.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
I see.
Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Yes it was.
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
What does it matter then?
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
I just asked his name.
You're scaring your sister.
Don't call me Father.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
No.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
It's like War of the Worlds.
They think it might happen all at once.
What do you mean, the horses?
Your next water ain't for three days.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Where's Jake?
Didn't Paden tell you that?
Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
I expect.
You haven't got any money.
Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
You own this land.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
What about the law?
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
All I did was kiss the girl.
Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks.
Daddy's dead.
Why would they stop you?
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
Well, thanks, but forget it.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
Stella.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
He left me.
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
I'm ready for that.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Hair and make-up?
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
There isn't one.
Well, shoot it on the last day.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Better late than never.
It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor.
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
When is she coming over?
Impossible.
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
It was a great show, Dad...
Because obviously she existed, right?
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
What I do to Simone?
Simone?
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
Somebody said she was here.
-- Please, get away from me.
I was misquoted.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
You understood them.  That's what was amazing.  It's a nice day.  Let's eat outside.
I love you too, daddy.
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
What?!
It was premeditated -- I knew exactly what I was doing!  I strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire!  I did it!  I killed her!
I know what you're up to.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
She was never in New Mexico.  She never left the studio.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
Dark?
My God, you've got one?
Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.
Taller, Viktor.
It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
... digitized.
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
I was hoping you'd say that.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
Yeah. Sorry.
If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?
Who me?
Yes.
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
Me too.
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
Don't fail me.
Yes, it did.
Are you wigging out?
What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
Where will you go, where no one has died?
Yeah.
They scare me too sometimes.
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
Like what?
Who!
Which street corner?
...Hi.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
I didn't do anything --
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Harvest moonshining!
He's right. Nice guitar break.
That's your grandfather you're talking about!  I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.
Who? Us?!
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Yes!
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Mmmm -- so can I...
You never had trouble communicating before.
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
What'll we do?
Hey, Grant.
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
I'm sorry.
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
Hell, I was game!
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
What can I do you for?
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
An existentialist.
Eyes on the road.
Having fun.
Driving?
They're both a challenge.
You just passed your nemesis.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
Yeah.
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Well, thanks for the lift.
Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
See.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Let's keep it that way.
Do I have a choice?
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
I'm at marker eight-five.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
We'll be waiting. Over.
Don't take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears about to pour over you like maple syrup.
What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B?
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
That's correct.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
You have a butler working that floor?
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
You're sure?
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
And that didn't seem odd to you?
But there were more of you?
You think so?
I left him a message.
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
-- You can and you will.
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
Like a mafucka.
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
A Fed? Like FBI?
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
What!?
Security's locking down the elevators.
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
Can it work?
I can trust Rheya.
A puppet.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
She was real.  Where did she come from?
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
Perhaps it did.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Jesus...
My Thomas is a little rusty.
Better.
Is it intelligent?
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
I did too.
You don't know?
I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
I think so.
Good.  Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
Those are dreams.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
Thank you.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
I never said I didn't.
Chris --
Then you won't make it.
I wish you wouldn't.
I can't --
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
Hello, Win.
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
Can we go then?
Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
Could be, I guess.
Tell it like it is.
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
They called here after you left...
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
Do you?
Yeah.  It's all over.
Nothing.
The gun?  It's in the upstairs closet.
I'm all right.
My ass if falling.
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
Oh, some shit.
She's got to identify him.
It's not your taste.
I'm not saying it's your fault.
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
Ever shot anyone?
No, I will not step outside.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
I know where everything is.
She's what?
Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
No. No, that's okay.
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
I know.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Mm-hmm.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Lemme down, bugface!
Mr. Jameson--
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Mr. Jameson--
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
He knew.
What if the world ends tomorrow?
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
Some prep school thing.
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
No.
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
Let's talk in the hall.
I will finish what I've begun…
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
Like it?
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
Just drop me off here.
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
Is you all good Nazis?
Any news on Dunbar?
He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
That's right.
Okay, Security -- what happened?
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Tipping me off? I do not understand.
Look, Lieutenant. All your dough won't help you here. Because here you're on your own. And no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Now let's see how good you can swim.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
It is.
I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
Then droppen Sie dead!
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
No?
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
You'll fix me up!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
It's not good for you, Animal.
This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
Animal! Animal! Wake up!
Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
Anybody cover?
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
Check.
You can tell Father Murray to --
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Are you questioning me?
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
What time?
What guy?
Russian women prisoners?
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
When is it expected back?
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
Population?
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
On screen.
You're in the Nexus.
I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one  I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.
Phasing? To where?
Where are the deflector relays?
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
The thought had crossed my mind.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Lock phasers and return fire!
We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
Incredible machine. Helmsman, one-quarter impulse power.
No reply, Chekov... Continue on course...
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
Not exactly.
And how many have paid the price for your impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done... And what is yet to come?
No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Do you have an explanation?
Aye, sir!
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
Red alert, Mr. Scott.
With some on the planet...
Come on!
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
... The needs of the few...
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
What must I do?
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
Say thank you.
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
I have my orders.
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
Carol!
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
Who --
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
You know what she'll say...
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
Don't you believe it.
Oh, I believe it.
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Admiral --
Aye, sir.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
Best speed, Scotty...
... No, sir. It has not.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
There is no such regulation.
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
<u>WHAT</u>?
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?
Aye, sir.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Stop engines.
Try again.
Course heading, Captain?
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
The question is irrelevant.
... They do, indeed.
Just a couple of kooks...
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
A moment alone, please.
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
... Best shot...?
No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
Can you isolate the wave?
No, <u>my</u> name.
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
Understood. What is your plan?
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
We don't want to be any trouble.
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
Just lucky, I guess.
You're upset about losing the whales.
So. There we are.
Permission granted.
There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
But you said toxic.
... Simple logic.
Yes.
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
Why not?
The tank will be finished by morning...
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Our <u>mission</u>! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about <u>that</u>!!
I will, Admiral.
Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
I'll have to re-energize.
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
I notice you're still working with polymers.
That's the ticket, laddie.
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
There are caves in those mountains.
What's the rush?
I aspire to be more than I am.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
No, I mean...
Androids... don't have...fun.
Data doesn't breathe.
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Yes. But look at this medscan...
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.
Another time.
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
We're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
I don't believe it happened that way.
Deck ten.
Beam him out!
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
What...?
If that's true, they're a dying race.
... I believe you...
Good hunting. Hayes out.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
I'm your creator now.
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
Ready quantum torpedo.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
Where's the Sphere?
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
I told you, there's no --
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
Understood. Keep me informed.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
Initiate pre-ignition sequence.
Yes.
There's a few of us left.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
Yes, he is.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
Or...?
Why?
Yes, sir.
Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
Agreed. Options?
Understood!
Where the hell are they going?
The charge is murder.
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
Don't remind me.
Come on...
Now there's a poser.
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
Yes.
For insubordination.
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
You tell them, Lieutenant.
Sulu!
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
LET THEM DIE.
I am uncertain.
From Enterprise?
Not yet... Section 4236...
... is to trust him.
Faith...?
An omission. After that -
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Then it's time we were heading home. Three years is...
And if they're still in place?
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
Why?
I do not understand.
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
Yes, sir.
Of you?
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
With pleasure, Captain.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
I know how he thinks.
No!
You sick bastard!
Understood.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
What do we know about the planet?
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
We’ve got him!
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
Aye, sir.
Number One.  You have the bridge.
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly...
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
Counselor?
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
You're not Reman.
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
Why are you here?
I see more than what you are.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
Find her again.
No -- this is wasting time.
Seven minutes.
They will obey, Praetor.
I have a purpose.
Now go. I have some personal business.
Sure.
Credit card.
We should have. Let me see.
No.
Where did you stop last?
Stay right there...
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
It's taken on a disguise.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
What's all this for?
Don't... don't do this... please...
That way.
Smile... good?
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
When we get here.
A baby is a new person?
I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
But I speak English.
Yes.
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Yes?
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
He will.
I am your friend.
I do not want to.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
I feel better if I move.
The cook.
No one's traveling in this weather.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
You promised.
No.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
But...
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
You want the baby to laugh at me.
I will wave to you.
I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
My grandmother's rich.
Would be kinda neat if they were. I think I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter.
Can you see under the faceplate?
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
You know that's impossible!
I wouldn't think so.
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
Just not the eyes.
No problem.
Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
I just got to talk to you for one second.
You talked to Iris?  When?
Step into my office.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
He records himself raping and killing her--
Is he dead?
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
Jesus!
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Let's talk in the car.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
Are you sure it's real?
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
But that doesn't add, does it.
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
S'okay.  I know you still love me.
Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
How long does it last?  Oh.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
Anybody talk to the press?
That's right, Jan.
What does the Manager say?
Hi there.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
What do you want from me?
How did you know he was a construction worker?
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
How long ago?
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
I want to catch Dick Low, more than you can imagine, but I cannot risk going public. What happens when the media finds out that a former FBI Special Agent, a founder of the Behavioral Sciences Unit, is not dead, but instead alive and killing people, not ordinary people, but, even worse, serial killers, making him some sort of white knight vigilante?  You keep at it. We'll find him, we'll find him in our own way.
I understand.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
Dick Low's a killer too.
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
None taken.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
Doesn't fit.
The man knew how to dress.
Don't even go there. What's up?
You want to have dinner?
They're all criminals?
This is some serious shit.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
Don't be too harsh.
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
Because you asked him to, stupid.
I know.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
I'll be back.
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses, I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job, even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them.
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.
The boy's okay. I saw him...
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
Thomas Mackelway.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
I know, I know.
You're right. I know.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
Like what?
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
...not until you book it...
...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
I'm a "Dorothy".
The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
...The red piece of shit over there...
...get the hell outta here already...
How are you doing?
Yeah?
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."
Oh no?
Oh.  Where is this place?
It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...
Oh boy.
She wasn't your type anyway.
I didn't make it...
No, man, we're in the play-offs.
So, what? Eleven?
Rejected?
We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.
Mike?
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
That's right.
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
VEGAS.
What Vegas?
We're going to Vegas.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
Baby, we're money.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
This version doesn't have fighting?
Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
She didn't see.
...How novel.
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...Shut up, Sue...
...it's on.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
Yes. 
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
And what is that Bonasera?
But your daughter is still alive.
Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
You have to answer for Santino.
Your girl friend.  She says she can't make it tonight.  You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
Ba Fa Goulle.
Yeah.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
You mean Tattaglia.
Barzini.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
I'll need him.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
Shhhhh.
Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
That's for you to find out.
The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Mama, no.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Sure.
Michael.
How is your father?
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
Oh Michael.
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Is he alive?
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
Shut up!
Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
That's funny.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
I met him in New York.
No, I think your mother, her illness --
This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz.
Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Copy out from here...
Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?
Is Freddie here?
That's good.
I've got plans!
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
Really? To Italy?
Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
I just don't believe that!
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
I told you! I knew it!
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
I hope so.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Is Freddie in Rome?
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
You know what -- I am.
Where have you been since then?
Ten thirty?
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
It's fantastic.  I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
Of course. What happened to your face?
I really don't want to see anybody.
That's an expensive gun.
Is there a firing range around?
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
Well, we're all working tonight.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. 
Where do you live?
Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
I know. I could have picked you up.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
Well, I hope he wins.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
How long has he been there?
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
That ain't much of a name.
No.
I don't remember.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
You want to make it like this? 
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
Do I look like a narc?
Yeah.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
We don't need any misfits around here, son.
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Some. Here and there.
Military record?
Yes, Sir.
I was in the Army too.  And I'm good with crowds.
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
Anything you say, officer.
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
It happens.
The taxi life, you mean.
Thanks.
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
Yes.  You'll be outside.
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
You knew?  All this time?
I'm not a fool, Billy.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
I had it, a minute ago...
You look... different.
After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall.  Everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  So they stuck it down here.
Do you have the...
What?
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
Nine and-a-half years...
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
Dad, I...
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Sandra Sinclair.
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but it's a little big.
Can we get him to the hospital?
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Huh?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
You should watch what you say.
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
It's wrong, Leo.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Cat.
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
Oh.
Oh.
I already have.
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
Cathy?
Yes.
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Would you like some brandy?
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
Then what was it?
Because she was afraid.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Look.
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Just listen to them!
Just a little one.
Are you coming to my party?
Try my best.
Yep.
Yes?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
The two kids?
Mmmm.
Yep?
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Well, you're the lawyer. 
We'll make our own fog.
No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
Lovebirds, I see.
Mother, where did you go to law school?
I know, Mother.
Maybe we ought to leave.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
You don't have to.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
Please.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
What?
What made it...
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
Criminal.
Only violators and practical jokers.
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
Right next to the one you already had.
You are, aren't you?
Dinner's just about ready.  We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
Yes.
I think it could be fun.
I have several jobs.
I do different things on different days.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
I'm glad you do.
What?
What'll it say?
Last night? What do you mean?
Of birds?
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
You have nothing to lose but your feathers.
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
You said three o'clock.
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
What were the crows after at the school?
Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
We can't be sure of that.
Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.  Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
What?
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
Don't call me that confounded name.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
I've had some experience.
Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
I've ordered nothing from you.
Get out of here!
We have never been friends.
Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
What did you hear?
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
Yes, Doctor.
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
You can get out.
See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
What? Call the police?
What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
I don't want to see!
It's not. I can't take it.
Yeah, we do.
I know.
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time.
About them. You've got to leave it alone.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Okay.
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Why not, Bobby?
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
I don't believe it.
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
Just Klaatu.
Sit down, Mr. Harley.
About 250 million of your miles.
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
Not very good news, I'm afraid.  The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night.  Let me read you some of the replies.  "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow."  "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."  Well -- there you have it.
I'm afraid my people haven't.  I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
Well, we could--
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
Is that what you're thinking about?
May I walk out with you?
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
It won't work.
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
No -- no, thanks.
No -- I'm afraid not.
They would have killed this man?
Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
He's a vampire alright.
Fine!  Stay here!
They're gonna book us.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
You're eating maggots.  How do they taste?
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
Hey, take it easy.
How do you know they're not?
Chill out Edgar.
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
No, I just like to read the <u>T.V.</u> <u>Guide</u>.  Read the <u>T.V. Guide</u>, you don't need a T.V...
Lots more where he came from.
I hate goin' into town.  That's about as close to town as I like to get.
This is Michael.
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
No.  Just you.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
I'll pass.
Okay.
Smells like something died.
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
But, Mom...
No, I'm not...
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
Okay.
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
Huh?
Save Laddie first.
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
Nowhere.
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
What?
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Don't walk behind me.
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Was dark... find a light...
No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
Then I'll have to kill you.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it.  You play chess?
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
Well, get to it.
After all this mess then.
How far's that?
What's that?
No.
Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Just keep looking.
Chance we got to take.  We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
It's the generator I think!  No power.
Well, let's get down there.
On the towers?
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
This has to end.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
Does this prove something to you? Have you made some great stand of which I'm unaware?
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
Trust me...
Your birth stone.  I thought --
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
I've seen it.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
You sound like my father...
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
I'm sorry, David.
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
I can't do that --
Thank you...
Why would you do that?
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
Or mud carriers.
It must have been safe.
Someone you loved very much.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
What's the matter with -- ?  -- What would I do without you, Mrs. Watchit?
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Because it's a new way of seeing the world!  Of seeing our place in it!
Yes.  I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to?  An elder or patriarch of some kind?
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
Kalen...
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
No, you're safe --
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
It's not my job to believe you.
My business?
You killed him?
And what does that mean?
I never touched your father! I swear!
No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
Yeah.
It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients...
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
Ok.
Believe me, I know.
You thought my father was crazy?
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
Why would we do that?
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
2004.
What about the world?
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me!
You still don't believe me, do you?
Who told you this?
You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that.
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
[Beat] Thanks.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
You like it?
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
Have a good day at work today.
Yes, baby?
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
I gotta go to Little Rock.
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
That's lonely for you, I guess.  I always think of motel rooms as lonely.
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
Who's your friend?
Louise, honey... Where are you?  You sound funny.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Not yet.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
Isn't this fun?
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
Just past Boise City.
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
I can see that.
Gosh.  It sure is.
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
Yeah, you want it?
What?
Whatever.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
You're drivin'.
Pass him!
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
You too, sweetie, the best.
Go?
Fuck that.
Hi there!  You alright?
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
I guess.
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Yeah, right.
I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.
What?
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
No.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
'That right?
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
Stalker, huh?
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
No thanks.
Nepal? Have you been?
I already know it, Mary.
I beg your pardon?
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
-- Love story of our time.
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
So she hasn't changed?
Oh my.
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
That's exactly why I don't watch 'em anymore -- it's bullshit! Why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid?
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Thanks a lot, Ted.
Just a minute.
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
No short game.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
Shhhhhh!
I think a little of both.
I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
What --
And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President.  John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?
We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Yes it is.
-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
It shouldn't have. But it did.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
Deal.
He was.
This is about Cuba.
Wrong, and you get to wax my car.
No way.
They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
Jesus Christ...
Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
Good.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
And get rid of the dog.
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
You're steppin' on sign.
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
You've got no jurisdiction.
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
Easy. Easy... I'm goin'.
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
Ray --
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Not no more.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
Listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
Never mind.
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
Leavenworth a tough joint?
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
Yes, ma'am.
Two meters.
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
Yes. I'll give you that!
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
I'm different.
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
You're horrible
And now I want you.
I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work.
In that order?
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part.
You don't have to do this.
I want it back.
Hardly ever.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
Strip reality! How do you play that?
That's up to you.
And that's one!
We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...
I live here, remember?
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Sir?
Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang.
ROGER, COUGAR.  Okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt.
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
BREAKING LEFT!
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
Is it you?
What do you want?
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Like what?
This is Maverick.
Mister to you.
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Just once, if they take your plane away.
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!
I didn't ruin her.
SHIT!!
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
IT'S MY SHOT.
WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
You saved our lives. You did it!
No. You can be mine!
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
Three guesses.
COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK.  I'M GETTING HUNGRY, LET'S HEAD FOR THE BARN. ...COUGAR, WHERE ARE YOU?
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
I called your house.
Or....
I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers.
You think I shouldn't fly.
Would you take me back? Would they?
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
And you get a kickback.
Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
Fuck you.
Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
I know that.
Yes, sir.
Nice to meet you.
Forty-one A, Ernie.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Where?
Oh, Rekall.
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Poor baby.  This is getting to be an obsession.
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
Bye.
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
Let me finish!
They did!  But I killed them!
It was implanted by the Agency.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
Let me go!
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
The one in the mine!
Good.  You've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail.  So, here's the plan: You and Heather go for help. Get to the mountains...
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
Burt, can you hear me now?
Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back.
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
Well, who put you two in charge?
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
You're really leaving, huh?
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Well, sure.
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
You're hung up again.
I am not!
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Screw you.  For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
Right.
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
We're in deep shit over here. Let's change that plan.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
Okay, ten dollars.
Why do you all keep asking me?
Please... I need to sleep...
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
The hell you do. At this hour?
I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers.
Ah.
No. No...
You fucking swear to shut up!
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
Of course.
-- an angel dust dealer --
We're taking the other case.
George is a fucking burnout case. I didn't want him on the stand anyway. Get more names from Billy.
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
Nothing has. But that's all changing.
That's right.
...Okay...
I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
-- Every word.
What is your rank within La Compania?
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
That's right.
And you b-believe that.
Albert.
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
I want you to kill for me.
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
Can you tell me what their names were?
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
No.
Did she ever mention any friends?
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
Say no more.
What happened to her?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
A blue rose.
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
Cole said she was 17.
It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
I'll get my kit.
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
I don't know what to do.
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!
No, you should forget about last night.
But Bob isn't real.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Oh, yes... yes...
I'm so sorry, Laura.
We're on our way, Baby.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
Not now.
What about tonight?
What's going on?
What?
Mom... what are you wearing?
I was down the street.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
We thought it was just.
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
I... yes.
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
I know of him.
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Yes.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course...
That's right.
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
'Code Blue'...
Yes. I wrote it.
Yes.
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
Yes? Galvin, right?
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
I'm sorry...?
...that's perfectly all right.
Yes.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
Why?
Really. How wonderful for you.
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
You're going to stay here...?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes. Price...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
...fifty thousand dollars?
I'm going to see you get that chance.
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
What do you want?
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help.  Mick, will you help me...?  Will you help me...?
Admittance form is wrong.
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
...Gruber's not bad.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
Oh shit, what's today?
I can't talk now.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
What difference can that make...? All right...
...you need some old forms that she had... somebody's dying...
What?
...they start again three minutes earlier...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Huh. And why is that?
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
The Big Boy did...?
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
Hey, how about that!
It hit sideways and skidded in.
How can you say that when you don't know him!
Where are we?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
I have no close folks.  My parents died when I was a kid.
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
It was nearer than that.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Chase, it's Dylan!
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
Diabetes?
No.
I like this story.
The mean old man with the claws.
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
Here.
A story?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Call it a guess...
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
Fred Krueger did it.
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
'S okay.
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Robert?  I...
It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Yes sir.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
Okay.
Wanna bet?  Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about.  You know why it takes me so long to write papers?  because I can't spell.  While everybody else is sleeping, I'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.
This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  When you stand up and are counted.
What was that?
I feel like... we can do anything.
Why then.
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
I just brought you something to eat.
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
That is unfortunate.  We'll have to take him with us.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
I know.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
I'm sorry, Skip.  It's this damned book.  Lawford gave it to me.
And being sixteen.
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
Read on, young John.  Read on. College boards are coming.
What?
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
No.
I'm not staying out here.
You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
Sorry won't cut it.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
For killing a dolphin.
It wasn't hard.
What's that supposed to mean?!
This be it?
Thought maybe Sparky and Buddy'd taken ya. Come on, I'll drive.
Sorry to hear it.
Ready for another?
Why not?
Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
She really say she was pregnant?
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Come on outside, I got somethin' to show ya.
Forty bucks...
Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
But I am also with the government.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
It has its moments of uncertainty.
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
This 'bout the fifth time?
See ya downstairs.
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
That don't seem fair.
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
You up for that?
You still got plenty energy for me, baby.
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
They sure do stink.
Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.
You certain?
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
I'm goin'.
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Uh huh.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
It's a comfortin' idea.
SAILOR!!!
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Come sit by me.
I'll come along.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
I ain't that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? Ain't you read about it?
Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.
Course I am, mama.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Put your shoulders back.
Put your shoulders back, I said.
Where we goin'?
It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
Life is unpredictable.
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
She's a transvestite.
Mm.
I thought you were tinkering.
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
Tripp.
Yes.
Shit.
Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
The truth. I know that's always been real important to you. Okay, check this out...
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.
Bullshit.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
Better luck next time.
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single- spaced?
Washed up?
Kinship. And what's here?
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
Because of my coat?
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
I don't know... 'Episodes.'
Okay.
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
Near Carvel?
Even if I end up going to jail....
Grady!
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Jesus.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
All right. This morning --
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
Did you confess?
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
What's that?
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
Yes?
What is it, Grady?
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
Only when I'm working.
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
That's all right. We'll find him.
You want to keep him happy.
If he's happy...  I'm happy.
When can I see her?
Is it because of Anna?
Huh?
Yeah. It's really nice.
Ah, come on.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
Sure.
Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
I don't like starlings.
You should hear the bird.
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
I have friends.
What?
They grow outside, don't they?
I don't know.
That's it. Little Red Riding Hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch.  Ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half?
You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
What's with the boxes?
Does he?
Do you like it when he asks you?
Yes you can, Robin.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
Bad idea.
Then think about it.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
What are you afraid will happen?
I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
I don't know.
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
Sorry.  Where is she?
I don't like nobody behind my back!
How do you feel about that?
I'm all right.
I'm talking about you.
Me?
I'll buy a plant.
K through sixth.
They could eat you.
What?
You're damaged.
Why do you want to know?
Yeah.
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
Hey, I'm not --
You don't really --
What?
I think it's a fucking good idea.
Just think about it.
I need a shower.
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
Wasn't up to me.
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up to fight.  You--
Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
If you say so.  It could be anything.
I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
It's trying to communicate.
Now what?
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
Tell me later.
Hi, lady.
No.
Do we just leave him there?
Why bring it here?
Got it. Over.
I can't... make it... podner.
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
Give me that!!
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Wilhite, anything?
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.
He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
Deep.  It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.
Wait for what?
We'll send the raft back to you.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
That must be Basiluzzo.
And why haven't they left each other?
And how do you explain that?
But then when will we see each other?
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
Does it please you to say such things?
What! Get married?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
Better dead.
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
What do you mean by sensible?
But for what reason should I come there?
It couldn't be any clearer.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
We, too, you know. It was disastrous. First at Panarea, where there weren't any boats... then at Lipari, where everybody was asleep... And the phone call to Rome...
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Why don't you try?
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
No, not like this one.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
And do you remember where she got off?
I don't see why I should mind.
I would like to ask you something.
Now listen, if I had any information, I wouldn't have come here to ask you. But I see that you, too, lack any information ...
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
Who?
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
Agnes...
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
Who?
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
Of God.
They were stained.
Yes, Mother.
Should you see a doctor?
Yes.
Who?
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
In the confessional.
In the middle of all the pain?
Where'd it come from before that?
Would you like to ask them?
Why do you smoke?
One.
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
Because I don't want one.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
Sometimes, yes.
She's dead isn't she?
She watches... she listens.
Yes.
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
Because I'm in trouble.
What kind of trouble?  What kind of trouble Agnes?
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
I had a baby.
Yes.
Will she be angry?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
What do you do?
I have to throw up...
Why?
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
Thanks...
Marty, what are you doing here?
You got to be crazy.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
I'll have a decision by next week.
You have proof?
No!
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
What business is it of yours..?
You can call me Sister.
Unfiltered.
Yes, but I...
I believe Agnes is different.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
Aquittal.
Answers.
What is it?
About what?
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
Don't deny it!
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Bullshit yourself!
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
No, it reminds me.
Long, thin and filtered.
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Even Christ would partake socially.
Do you think they ever existed?
Become?  One is born a saint.
I'd like to begin.
Begin what?
How  ?
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
What happened to the baby?
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Just you?
How about Ding Dong?
Read 'em!
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
Sixpence.
He'll be pulp by now.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
Bag-snatcher.
I'll have a bash.
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
Wake up!
We do.
Sorry.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Something like that.
I see.  Do you like the play?
Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
And cunning.
See you.
Of course.
You can learn from books.
I'm going parading before it's too late!
Have they?
But I'm clean.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
I think you're soft or something.
What little old man?
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
What's old got to do with it?
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
Well you're not going.
You've got a midnight matinee.
Well, you look like him.
Aye, but you know him well.
I knew I could rely on you.
Don't exaggerate.
Aye, I suppose so.
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
But John hasn't got any.
What?
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
Dell, plot our location.
I'll see what I can do.
What is it, I can't --
God I'm hungry.
Right.  Talk to you.
I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all.
That way.
Dead.
Dead!
Is it alive?
And when will you be ready to do that?
The engines are fixed.
And be right back.
What do you mean?
Maybe we can catch it.
Does anybody know what happened?
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
No.
We're not going anywhere.
Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
Maybe we could write it together.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
Are they close?
Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
Yeah?
They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
Right.  Fire up all systems.
But why draw it on the wall?
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
Martin, this is an order!  Open the door!
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
We're coming!
What do you think?  Now we go in.
Can we get to him?
No, I had to seal off a whole section.  We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
What can I do?
Do you want a tablet?
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
Match it!
Force the door.
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
What?
Just behind us, over to the right.
Is it still moving?
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.
Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
Want some?
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
You should hit the sack, too.
Give me a yell is something happens.
Phoebe?
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
Please do.
Do you know, Eve - sometimes I think you keep things from me.
D-day.
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
Did I say killer? I meant champion. I get my boxing terms mixed.
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
You have no right to say such things!
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
Yes, Addison.
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
You were there? At the play - last night?
She may be later than you think...
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
Naturally enough, your understudy.
Frankly, I don't remember.
Just slipped your mind.
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
I take it she read well.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Where's my coat?
All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
I get a party, don't I?
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
How is Eve? Okay?
I'll check with Eve...
What?
Twenty minutes!
For instance - you!
I must have frightened her away.
I'm trying terribly hard.
Here we go...
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
I've been aware of that for some time.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
It's not nonsense.
Hear, hear...
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
You know what I'm going to be?
So few come back...
Every day.
You hear all kinds of things.
I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
Miss Harrington...
What are you doing here?
You probably won't believe me.
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
Well...
I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
Not just that way. As a friend...
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
But the raves about your performance-
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
How are you making out in Mr. Fabian's office?  I don't want you working the child too hard, Max - just because you promised. As you see, I kept my promise, too...
I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
Roughly ten minutes.
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
Why should he - and why should you?
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
Where'd you get all that information?
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
When you do, let me in on it.
Don't be evasive.
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
What do you mean?
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
Call, what call?
Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
Are you breaking the contract?
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
We need a sympathetic face.
--you do?--with access to records?
I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
And I'm a Republican.
Go on, go on--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
--jeeeeeeesus--
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
--Howard Hunt?
Any idea what he did?
--Teddy Kennedy?
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
Chapin did contact you then?
Give me your checkbook then.
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
--you don't really think you're being followed?
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
Just let me get a match.
So tell me about the Times article.
Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
I'm not your source on that.
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?
--I'm not sure, it still feels thin-- 
OK.
--you have nothing more to say, I understand that.
So?
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
I have nothing more to say.
You don't mind getting on people's nerves, do you?
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
Haldeman too?
You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
Are you sure?
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
I can't sell hints to Simons--  --you called everyone you know?  Call someone you don't know.
Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, "When you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow."
Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
Howard--
That was awhile ago.
--go over your sources again--
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
Like what?
Uh-huh.
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Of course, I didn't --
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
I'm glad you think so.
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
What?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.
What?  We both have cars.
Sure.
No.
Then what the hell are you talking about?
You can crash at Stifler's?
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Just in time.
I'm not going.
Yeah.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Whatever you want.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Move with the music.
Um...okay...
You think so?
Not for you.
That's my trick!
No...I know the perfect time...
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
Shut the fuck up.
Yep.
Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
Would you shut up?
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Right.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
Why isn't it doing anything!?
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
I told him it wasn't ready...
Andy? Andy is that you?
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
What do you mean, maniacs?
Andy, it's not so easy. There are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under Paris. It's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... It's no man's land.
Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
I told you. These murders are not normal.
Are you crazy? We have nothing. Let him go, then watch him. If you're right, you can pick him up at midnight. Or maybe he'll lead you to the others. Just let him go.
Double merde.
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
You must have.
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
No!
You are the Princess.
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
Look!
It worked in Odessa...
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
Who are you?
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Portchnik.
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
Yeah, my grammy.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, sorry.
Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Why not?
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
H'm?
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
M'hm.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
Oh, yeah.
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
That's the key question.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
Yeah, I know it's small.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
Yeah.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Yeah.
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
There's a spider in the bathroom.
What?
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
It's for my complexion.
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Oh, I had the radio on.
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Holy cow!
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
What thing?
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
This is the first book that I got you.
Oh!
This is my room.
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Commentary.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
What-
You have a raccoon?
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
It's a narrow view.
Oh, do yuh?
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
You're crazy!
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left. Right?
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
M'hm.
M'hm.
She was stealing.
Yes, I do.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
I was a great beauty.
Oh yes.
Very well.
Why didn't you come in?
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Absolutely not.
I'm not that good.
And how's the diva doing?
With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if I can touch them.
It's alright, isn't it?
It's not going to come up.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.
Can I open it?
Sally?
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
Let's go upstairs, okay?
She's in ICU.
Excuse me?
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?
Fantastic.  Out here.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
Not.
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
You want me to uninvite her?
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
You can never be too early or too thin.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
About me!
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Anyone else?
Don't.
Don't do this.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
Don't do this!
You changed your mind.
I wanted you back.
Okay.
I guess.
It's a Calder.
Sure.
Has she called?
Come on, Panes...
Oh.  Well.  Good.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
No.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
Ah there's our snookums now.
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
We're way past inappropriate.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
I think he's really angry with me too.
I like you.
It was a mistake.  This isn't a plot to do in Otis.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
Well...wow...
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
Are you working on a new book?
I'm so sorry.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
That was my clue.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
Thanks.
So tell me, how's it going?
That's not an answer, is it?
I guess.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
She's such a great photographer.
Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
You weren't exactly horrified.
Are you asking me out to dinner?
No -- an <u>individual</u>!
Because...because he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are.  I could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an <u>individual</u>, and when I get married, it'll be to someone <u>I</u> choose.
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
Yes.
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Oh no...
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
Outstanding.  Princess...?
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
...Ants...
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Ma'am?
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
You wash 'em, you break 'em. I'll come back for them later.  If he makes trouble, give me a yell.
Why?
I should have stayed in bed last night.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Good night.
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
You mean tonight?
What time does the show go on?
I know your height, your weight and your Social Security number -- you had mumps, you had measles, and you had your appendix out.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
You shouldn't.
I thought so.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
Let me help you.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
In his apartment.
Miss. 
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
You don't have to entertain me.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
What for?
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
For me?
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
You did?
Over a girl?
The dishes?
Oh.
So I want you to keep a clear head.
Fine.
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
I'm fine all over.
In there.
Mr. Dobisch said that?
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
So it was.  She threw it at me.
Sir?
Put me down for Thursday again.
I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
Yes, sir.
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
No key!
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
It's only eleven -- and I just want the place for forty-five minutes.
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
I have a vague idea.
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Good night?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
No.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
That's enough, Fran.
I wasn't trying.
What do you think?
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.
I have a present for you. I didn't quite know what to get you -- anyway it's a little awkward for me, shopping --  -- so here's a hundred dollars -- go out and buy yourself something.
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
Sssssh.
I told you -- with my mother.
Where does she live?
Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
Lovely. You were a big help.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
Sit down -- we'll talk about it.
You can keep your fucking fuel --
North ?
Sometimes.
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
A long time.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Who are you ?
God knows.
I know.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point.
No shit -- hot damn --
Who knows what's up there?
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
Signs?
Too far inland.
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
Maybe.
Touchy.
Terminate ?
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
Thank you, sir.
Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that --
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
Who knows.
Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares the hell out of the slopes -- the boys love it.
You know you're right.
The truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it. And do you know why?  Yes, you know why.  Your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! How long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here.  Except me.
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
Yes...
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Were you with him, when...
Just something I read in the Free Press.
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
What is this bridge?
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
And shut up.
The war will still be here tomorrow.
No. Not really.
But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.
Right now -- I am.
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
139  CONTINUED:
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
The radio's on the fritz.
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.
That's not what I meant.
-- Permanently?
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
So what's the problem?
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
All you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to.  You don't understand shit!  Trappers, hunters -- we're part of the environment.  Who's protecting us?  I've seen plenty like you.  So -more-
I already have.

I'm living proof of that sad fact.
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
We'll go with you.
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
Get the fuck out of here.
They'll have to come right past us.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Not bad.
Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
Oh, please...
What's with the dark?
Yes.
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
What needs clearing up?
You take off when you have to.
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
Welcome.
Yeah... Well...
Go ahead.
What do you want?
What a break...
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
What a nice compliment.
I'll take care of myself --
Don't want to. I love you.
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
Yes.  No.
He's a pain in the ass.
Okay by me.
Wait here.
Terrify me?
Oh, is he dead?
No, I didn't.
It smells like shit in here?
I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
Another place where?
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
Where?
What restaurant?
So you're from around here?
Probably.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
Two years.  Two long fucking years.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
Take us there.
Know what?
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
Paid in full.
I bet you fucking know!
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
Why?
It's not the same, is it?
He was killed.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
The exotic women.
Because you are a women.
After that?
Why not?
Yes.
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Taiwan.
But he won't shoot you right then?
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
I told you, he will.
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
No?
I know.  It makes me crazy.
Why?
It can be.
Yes.
Who was she?
She was taken.
Why?
Martin.
What?
Okay.
I think you're supposed to answer that question.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
What are you thinking about?
Some.
How would you like the funds?
A coke, if they have it?
Hey Doug, you want a beer?
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
Wanker more like, what does he know about writing.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
You got my word on it.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Well, don't get carried away.
No....The Asylum!
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
You'd be better off with tables and chairs.
They'll never get us.
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
No, not yet.
You're all bloody useless.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
What happened to Katka?
A fine specimen for conversion.
Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
I don't want to ruin your day.
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
Lucky break!
Good, what's his number?
You could give me your baseball, so I can drive this bastard nuts.....He's been playing chequers for eight hours and still hasn't won a game.
Here!
What are you talking about?
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
I think he's jealous of Havel.
How about you Brutus?
Whatever!
No, not just yet.
No way Doug, I can't.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
Thanks.
But I love you!
Yep, it's all yours.
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Yo, dobree!
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it.
That's not what you said last night. And, I didn't bring that "prick" Josh.
What's the Bugler?
A champion of lost causes huh?
We_re not all running away
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
One beer, one coffee, thanks.
I had it coming from someone.
Sure!
Why don't we both forget about him?
Alright!
And you broke into that room?
Not all of them!
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
How do I know this isn't a trap?
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
Working....Under cover.
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
What for?
You really are a piece of work, you know that? You walk out on me and my family for some worthless bum and you expect us to help him when he screws up.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
We're not sure...
What if his accomplices have made copies?
You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
You're fine like that, Mom.
Me neither.
Later.
Were?
-- This play means a lot to me.
My act?!
Go for it.
You want to tell me...
Don't bother!
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
The dirty snowball at its core.
In ten words or less?
You don't believe in anything?
Yeah --
And why would that scare me?
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
No. Why? Are you seducible?
Me.
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
Yes.
This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
By making me ill, he is punishing me!  I just don't know what for.
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
How -- how long does she have?
How would you do that, Mr. Carter?
I'm as underprivileged as they are --
I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
Oh yeah.
What drill?
Bic... It's a Bic pen.
Run out of gas?
Shhhhhhhh!
A 35mm film chain... I'll see what I can do....
Don't you understand? The mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events, and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear.
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
Professor, be serious, would you?
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
Well, he's gone.
Oh yeah?
Okay.
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
Yeah.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Mmmmm.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
He'll say that?
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Quit my job.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
Yes.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains.
Wanta sue me?
Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
Not really.  This is pretty important.
What is it, Tommy?
Where's the professor?
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
Go away.  Let me rot?
It's kinda hard this way.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
A what?
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Why me?
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll sleep for a while now. What is it you have to do, exactly?
I'll bet. Jesus – "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
Stop it, Bill!
What else?
All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
Well... actually, no Bill...
Ever act?
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
What do you do far a living?
Okay.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Seen a doctor?
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this–
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to –
But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
I apologize, Barton.
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let YOU run the the studio. It doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run THIS particular asylum. So let's put a stop to THAT rumor right now.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
No.
Thanks.
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
Bring 1976 up.
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
How about the coke?
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
She said what you said she'd say.
Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.
I slept with her once in school.  I was just a kid.  I was experimenting.  It was just that one time.  She developed a... fixation... on me.  She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did.  It scared me.
About a year and a half.
Was there anyone with you last night?
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
No.
Because you didn't love him --
Thanks.
Didn't you study it in school?
Do you?
Why not?
Ice?
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
She's seen everything before.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
Fine.  How's your back?
No thanks.
What happens to them?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
I'm a writer,  I use people for what I write.  You write what you know.  Let the world beware.
What was the weapon?
Do you remember his name?
That's him.
Not now he don't.
Somethin', though.
He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
What do you want?
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
I'm sure.
On what basis?
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
I'm a painter, too.
Not sure. How was yours?
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Annina Nosei.
Who?
You should talk to him about this.
Sure.
I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
How do you know?
That's the same guy who did this painting.
I'm here.
Decipher?
Yes, I understand – but where do you take them from?
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
What?
We don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
Who said that?
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
Out?
Use your fucking instinct.
Oh yeah..
Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny.  "Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me." I did say chicken!
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
Hi Gina.
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
I ain't John Henry.
Good. What do you have?
I guess it was a long time ago.
I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear?  How could you do that to me?
Manzanita....  ... if one day I die, and you read this piece of paper, I want you to know how much I love you. Although I'll never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face'
Well thanks!
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
I'll make you another one.
No, actually I feel worse.
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Didn't I say that?
I'm tempted.
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
Yeah?  Me too...
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
I don't know anymore, Bruce ...
I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
Weird, huh?
It does to me.
One way to find out?
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
My lips are sealed.
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
Too good?
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
Women.
Pheromones?
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
What are you talking about?
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Divide and conquer.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
I can make it.
Definitely.
Just the beast.
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
I see you knew him.
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
Bruce?  What are you doing?
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
Dear daisy, don't despair.
OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
One kiss, my love.  For luck.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
I think they're getting worse.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
No. You said I. I killed them.
What?
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
What do maniacs always want?
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Master Wayne's dead wives.
Four seconds from...
And you are?
I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
My life's an open book. You read?
Wait. You can't go.
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
On occasion. Usually at night.
He sure did.
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
What?
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
What are you talking about?
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
Let's see if you bleed green.
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
Here. Get a good seat.
Miss.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
... Murderer...
... Where are you taking me?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
Good.  With any luck we'll run into each other.
Odd desire for anyone.
I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
What now?
I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.
What are you, scared of heights?
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
He's not crazy.
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
Tom Jones?
Sort of half.....
About Charles...
Ahm.... .
Howls he getting on with the family?
She's ... well, she's good.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Er ... pray tell me why?
Of course not.  I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement.  A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.
What makes you say that?
There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
Not at all, Governor.  Very striking.
This sucks.
What's your problem Beavis?
Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
Uh... I think you scared them off.
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
What's your problem Beavis?
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Oh, that's nice.
Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
You scored with two chicks?!
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
No, Jane.
We're rich in what really matters.
I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
They make gypsies look good.
No, I'm not putting up with this.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
Wait.
This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
Little black party dresses?
Let's see if she can get my model back.
Really.  I don't know.
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
Can you scare them off?
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
We have to start simpler, is that it?
We're...
What do you expect?  You're dead.
About what?
Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now.  This house is too big.  It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
I want to get in.
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
Good girrrl!
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
Then <u>I'll</u> help them.  For a price.

That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
Stepmother's...
I cannot believe this.
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
I thought I saw something.
Gooood!
Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
I'll need something personal of theirs.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Oh, fine.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
It's fine today, Robert.
Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that.  Please, sit in the chair.
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
Oh, really?
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
Good night, Eve.
Hello, Dennis.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Thank you.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
I agree.
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
Do you think so? Do you think so?
I agree.
Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
A flower...
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Yes. I like to watch very much.
I can't read.
I agree.
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
Yes.
Yes. That is surprising.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
I hope so.
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
I see...
Since you were a child?
Compensated...?
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
Correct.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Do you need a secretary?
Good evening, Wilson.
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
... Would you take me on a tour?
... Yeah...
He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
No problem, Chief.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
No, sir.
Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.
That could be possible...
You take care too, Bobby.
Who am I thinking of?
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
May 11th.
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. We’re supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
I want to try.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
Why?
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
People make mistakes.
Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help.  Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
I said "yes."
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
Thank you, sir.
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
Why not?
Somebody told you.
The usual, Barry.
Yikes.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
Good. We'll sell tickets.
You wanted to be partners with me?
I'll protect you, Dollface.
You're evil, Maxine.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
Hush, sweetheart.
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
The Great Mantini?
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek.
Fork ah did?
Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Think, Jew florist?
Says who?
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
Do we get to wear a crown?
I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
Yes, Hi.
Did you see the reviews?
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
Do you mind?
I'm getting better all the time.
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
Say the Word!
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
Oh.
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Yes ma'am..
Won't you be late for work?
Morning, ma'am.
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
He ask, I give him anything.
Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.
You know as well as I do, Stamp, that people who die bad don't stay in the ground.
Just me.
You planning to do anything about it?
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
I don't believe that. I won't.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
Who is she? Where she come from?
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
Yeah. Too sweet. 
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
What do you think?
Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
The Gundersons.  It's a wandering daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Gunderson. Her parents want her back.
We have the urn.
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
Please!  Please!
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
No, they--
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
Oh yeah?
Take a look at this, sir.
A hundred.
That's really thoughtful but I--
The main guy, Dieter--
Well--yeah, I guess--
Well yeah...I know that.
Do you still have that doctor's number?
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
Well...no, of course not--
What?
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
No, you're not wrong--
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
Just for making the hand-off?
It's your roll.
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
Uzi?
Walter, please--
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
Walter--
Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson!
Look, man, did you--
Dude?
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
Yeah?
Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff.
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
Are you employed, sir?
Huh?
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
Stay away from me, mister!
Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
We're going to be working as a unit, you people will be taking orders from me.  So let's get it over with.  I'll give you a free shot, Reinhardt.
Minutes.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Like cancer with a purpose.
Really?  What are we supposed to do, then?  Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live?  What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you justify saving people like that?
Not good.
I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.
It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
Scud.
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Nope.  Back then we did not.
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?
It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her.
How can you be out here?
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
You're blind --
There are other ways to see. Sit.
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
He didn't. Get over it.
Preventive medicine.
Like what?
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
You don't understand. The Thirst --
I know. Take some of my blood.
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
What?
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
But you use blood banks --
We weren't sure we could trust you.
Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
--my God, Nick???
Nick!!
Inside the grave?
Something was wrong.
Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
--fine, later, fine.
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
--bullshit!
Sleep.
What'd you dream?
Whatever you want.
I know, I know.
--hours before--
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
What? That made her lose the baby?
Something. Someone.
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
What're you, nuts?
Just go.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
--I don't know.
Yeah. Me too.
Goes right along with these two.
Anna's the witch.
--about the Witch--
This isn't about us.
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
At least you still have the tapes.
Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
....I don't know.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
--I know!
Heather.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
--fuck Anna!
Why?
--thank you for calling--
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
Sort of...
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
With your gun?...
I think someone's watching.
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
I told you. I like you.
Back where?
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Yeah.
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
It's not strictly legal.
You're an idiot.
I want you to go fishing.
Ya catch any fish?
...What?
Listen, what is it? Is it done?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Right. Sorry.
Pour that back.
Right.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
Tuesday.
What?
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Not yet.
Hello, daddy.
Yes, but.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Never before this.
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm alright. go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
No. I should go.
I want you to hurt me.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
You called me Jeffrey.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Am I bothering you?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
That sounds good.
Why not?
Are you sure?
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
I can't dance fast.
NO.
Go ahead!
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Yeah?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
I'll get a coat for her.
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Derek!
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
It's garbage.
What?  Yeah, sure.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
Barbara and me.  No one else.
That was out of line.
Get me a six pack.
What?
I don't want to talk about it.
What kind of project?
Good night.
Because I got caught.
Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
I need you to go to Miami.
Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
I don't give a shit.  Close enough.
I love you too, man.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat!  This man is having a heart attack.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
People tell me that I am crazy.  That my business will never work in your country.  What do you think, George?
Diego is my brother.
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
I'm sorry, George.
Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George.
I'm going to California.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
Figured what out?
Tuna.
Figured what out?
I like fire.
Put that shit away, they're here.
She did that before.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say something like that.  Always thinking about yourself.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado.
Who's the co-pilot?
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
Stoned?
So, we need to get to the source.
Who speaks Spanish?
Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Sid Ahmed.
Which "district" do you belong to?
Third group. What's your assignment?
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
Because it hasn't all been erased.
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
What about the will?
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.  Your witness.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Sit down, Frank.
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
Back off, John.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
A little after eleven.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Thank you.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
Show me.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Yes.
She didn't.  She just left.
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
She was.
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
I suggest it never happened.
It's a white powder that comes in a vial.
I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
Yes.
Yes.
Then you would have gotten your money?
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
Why'd you come here?
You didn't know about it before that?
Yes.
I'll have you out in a few hours.
I'm the photographer.
It's not my taste.
What would?
It's only the beginning.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
You're a monster.
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
I am relaxing.
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
Where have you been?
It's bad enough that you are.  It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
No treasure maps, huh?
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
No, I don't think so. I --
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
I bet mom could've helped her.
Nobody did.
Oh, yes.
She changed.
Not this kind of heat.
You want me to call the doctor?
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
Yeah.
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
No.
Oh.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
WHAT!
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
Want another cigarette?
Francesca. Robert.
Yes. Very clean.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
I'd appreciate it. I like knowing who I'm stealing from. If you can't create art I think the least you can do is recognize it around you, don't you think? There is...  ... so much beauty.
I would love to come for dinner.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Are you hungry?
How about Bari?
Yes.
Uh-huh. And?
No.
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Well, what is this?
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
WHY?
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
What makes it different, Robert?
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
It's only four days.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
Just some flies.
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
Pat's right.  It'll be fun.
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
But that's your old hood, Pops.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
Patrick, he's...
Okay, okay.  Listen:
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
You was just doing your job.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
It was just like in my head.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
What we have to do is call the police.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
You want to get into this now?
The money I bet it was nothing to get it clean, after you made such a fucking big deal ...
No!
Gimme the gun.
I can't.  I can't.
Jesus, Caesar!
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
It was him.  I'm positive.
But you know he did it.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
Just hurry.
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
You murdered Gino!
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Caesar, you don't know shit.
Go right ahead, sir.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Sure.
Where in the hell is he?
Oh yeah.  Violet!
Good guess.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
My pleasure.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
A beer?
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
Almost five years.
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
The redistribution of wealth?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
Shit, here we go.
I don't understand - ?
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
I suppose he just wants to watch.
Do you think you know me like that?
...  shit.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
Not Caesar.
C!  Shit, I'm sorry!
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
I won't.
I was so afraid you ...
...  Me neither.
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
And what if I couldn't do that?
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
-- sir? --
We thought you were gone for good.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
I've got a situation here and --
Get the fuck away from my car.
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
That's what I'm saying.

When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
I don't know.
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
I trusted you.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
-- how? --
-- forget it --
What is that?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Not really.
So get the hell out of here.
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
xxxxxx
That's the only angle.
What's that?
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
<u>Where am I</u>?
...ditioning.
... new washer.
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Too late? That's for me to say.
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Long time no see!
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
They weren't at school with us.
We don't make mistakes.
Do you know what you're doing.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
What?
How do you think I feel? You shit!
Jack ...
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Them?
Us. Them. I don't know ... just get going.
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Why?
Suit me?
Well, terrorists of course.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
We? Don't blame me!
Shit! The house is on fire!
Go away.
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
What happened to you after ...
You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
But if they did promote you
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Hang on.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Next of kin!
Here.
Don't mention it. See you later.
I delivered it.
What's the matter?
She didn't say anything about it to me.
There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.
I'm sorry but ...
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
Er, yes ...
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
Who's that? 
Monsieur. Quel numero.
Fixed?
But ... I called Central Services.
What?
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
He looks like a cop.
He's not a cop, he's a medic.  I'm CY Coates.
I can't hold up my head anymore.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
What about Kanita?
Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.
Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
Yeah?
His heart's beating.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
Our Lady of Misery.
No.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
He's working a double shift.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
The ghosts--
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Greatest job in the world.
What do you think?
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
A medical miracle.
How can that be? He was getting better.
The brakes are shot.
Why?
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
You're crazy.
What?
He's drunk.
Faster!
No way!
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
And the rule was...
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
What's wrong with it?
It just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
Just don't physically...  Fantastic tip -- fantastic.
London.  That's a promotion!
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
Yes.
Yes.
Sure.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
We can cut back at the end.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Yes.
They're not that dumb, after all.
Yes.
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
You too.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
This isn't friendship.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
You didn't say anything to her?
I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
Yes, there is.
I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
Yes.
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
I see the change in you -- I see it.
Okay.
No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
...good-bye then.
They fired me.
I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this.  Sorry. Go ahead.
Okay, sweetie.
Honey?...
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
I don't write.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
One year...almost one year.
How's it going?
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
Okay.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
It's not important.
Yeah.
What?
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
Where are you?
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Through the closet.
...that way we have someplace to go when we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my head and look nerdy.
Yeah.
Are you nervous, Walter?
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Is the manager cooperating?
Honest?
Of course...it's wonderful.
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Oh yeah?
Walter!  Jeez!
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
I do the research.
Not only that, he copied us!
I know, man.
I know, man.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Let's check out the scene.
I didn't buy it I made it.
I said I did, didn't I!
Well it sure looks dead enough.
Sure!  So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
Well, w-what did you do?
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
You're like an undercover guy!
Smack?
Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive.
Walter shut up and relax!
NO YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME DON'T SHOOT -
Hiya Maxwell.
Your work, the layers of irony.
Really?
Shut up!  You let him have it!
Andy!
Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
Amazing!
Bummer metaphor.
You didn't like them.
I mean it.
Hi, guys.
Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
You were having a nightmare.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
So I noticed.
You left me a message?
I think you've forgotten something.
Is that your car?
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
You want some water or something?
I'll back that up.
Why'd you come back?
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Please.  It's so '91.
I forgot.
Why?
Yes.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
Lothos.
I have cheerleading squad.
Skip it.
It's true.
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
Same one.
Oh.
You are such a wet.
A what?
I...
There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Why?  Why me?
Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan.  He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth.  They are a plague upon us.
Hi, Grueller.
Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a woman!
No --
But --
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Well, I hope so.
Right!
Well, look who's here.
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
You said "Crash".
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Catch?
My right nostril?
There are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida".  The pingala starts with the left testicle  and ends at the right nostril.
Switch nostrils?
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
Just till I lose.
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
it's okay..
Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him--c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do--
That's great!
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
I don't dance.
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
I want to be had.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
No.
Who's he play for?
You missed him!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
You're outta here!
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
Yeah, thanks for everything.
And where can I go?
Love to--
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
It's a miracle.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
Your breaking ball's getting better but ya need a change up.
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
Was I at that dinner?
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Right back.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
Mommy.
Listen...
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
Thanks, pal.
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
I'll be honest with you.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
She came to talk to me...
Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody.
The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care.
Why?
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
What are you -
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
I just told you. She called me.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
Why is she eight pounds over?
...position...
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
Oh, no.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
Hey, Mitch.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
Okay.
Oh, it's so soft.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for.
Yeah, how do I know?
If not for me, at least for Amy.
How serious?
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
He needed some clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
I threw it away.
Oh, you are...
Let me in the house! Fucker!
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
How many kids do you have?
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
You're firin' me?
Green?
Ye-yeah.
What?
Is this yours? Your pen?
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Mm.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
What expenses?
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
And here. Here.
Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' -
You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!
Yeah?
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with?
Nicky, I did -
I did - I didn't -
Nicky, I'm sorry.
Fuckers!
Oh.
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
And I mean... that's no good.
Are you sure?
Hm.
That's enough now!
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Hi, how are you?
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
You're so nice. 
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
I'll be there.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
It's what you want?
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
Well, you know...
Yes.
Come on! 
I'm here.
Okay, then.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
He was just on the phone.
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
No, I'm gonna drive.
You're driving me nuts!
...they're in Penthouse K.
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' bank. I don't know. They're all over the joint.
Take it easy!
No more! You see? Watch!
Again!
Then do it the way you want.
You have to dial nine first.
I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
I wonder..
You're probably right.
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
I'm not afraid. Are you?
I'm sure.
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
My dog!
What did you say?
Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.
What's the matter with you, Spooky, my most trusted comrade?  We are warriors!  These are the challenges we live for!
I know.
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
Ask me another one--
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
Yeah, as in born before..Ooh, I suppose it's "sexual harassment" to give a woman a compliment. Sheesh. Come on, gentleman...
Uh. "Thanks?"
Like you don't know...
I'll let you know.
But I'm blind.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
Don't you have children?
Taking messages.
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
Wake up.  Make a right at Ocean Avenue.  The hotel's a few blocks up on the left.
How was I in the wrong?
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
If you know that just back off.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
What do you keep making me out to be?
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
Don't lay this on me!
Then hang up!  Do it!
Who?
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Don't move around.  You don't want to puncture a lung.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
I'm not looking to get myself killed.  I just hope the battery on this phone holds out.
Our house always needs touching up.
A price on everything.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
Don't say that.
I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.
God, if he doesn't come back --
They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be --
Yes.
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Shit.  I'm sorry.
Damned if I know.
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
You, I would've noticed.
You were at the Emerald that night?
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
You're enjoying this too much.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
Think you could do a picture of me?
That's not good enough.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
Keep talking.
Granted.  But I don't believe they're grieving enough for their chauffeur to piss away their own futures.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
I still don't see you.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
Better reassure him.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Are you busting my chops or what?
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Mind if I have a look?
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
An excellent quality.
You heard me --
It's Dave.
She's not that either.
Nothing.
They're jealous.
Whiskey.
No.
Yes...
Maybe.
You say that like a gentleman.
Yeah.
Aha.
I'm thinking of your man.
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
So I'm sorry.
Ask to meet me again.
Probably.
Absolutely.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Come on.
No.
Not here.
What's her?
She's the thing you had to tell me.
You could say that.
And you're not going to tell me more?
You'd do anything for me?
You promise?
What condition?
Died...
Let them come then.
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Tell me what she wore.
Do I?
Thirty-five.
Carnations.
You know her, Jimmy?
That's wise, Tommy.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Aha.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Have a look at him.
Suits you.
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
What do you mean?
Och, you do, Fergie.
Of course. I forgot.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
Yes?
Yes.
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days.
Who'd you think it was?
I thought it was Dave.
Fuck you, too --
Good.
It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. His security's in the car beyond.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
I seen your fucking face.
No fucking way.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
Absolutely not.
Best game in the world.
Best game in the world.
Hurry up, would you?
Don't be so sure.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Like what?
Who's Dil?
My special friend.
Yes, but --
I think that's what you ordered.
How was I leading you on?
Oh!
No -- I guess not.
It's all right -- look.
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.
The letter --
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Barely, yes.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Steal it how?
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Me? Why me?
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
Next, please.
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Around one.
Then how do I know this is your office?
Brian.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
No.
Or you --  Or you --
Why you lied to me.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
There, you said it.
Said what?
Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
What are you doing?
Cutting it out.
Maybe.
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
Hm?
How often do you go through this little ritual?
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
But his mother --
I wish you wouldn't.
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
Voilà what?
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
How's that?
Well, you're honest, anyway.
How did you find out?
Doing what?
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
I wasn't --
How do you shave in there?
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
How would you like a spanking?
What?
Good night.
Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Va jouer, mon ange.
Ça alors! From Charles?
How can you tell?
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
He took care of Charlie for us.
You do?
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
It can't be.
What did you hear?
No. I'll handle this.
Are you sure?
She's still a virgin.
No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
This will relax her.
St. Michael's.
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
She was murdered?
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Why?
I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.
You're the killed.
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
You think you're my sister?
Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
NO?!
No.
I won't.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Twenty eight years ago.
Follow me.
Why?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
Yes!
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
I'm making you feel like meat?
Yes?
You can ask me anything.
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
What?
That's what he said.
The library. I'll be fine.
Attacked how?
You didn't believe her?
Kenny's aunt?
His mother's an only child.
I'm worried about someone.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
They're tasty.
No, you keep one.
You're the one who's hand is shaking.
You can't bring it.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
At least somebody likes this shit.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Since today.  New policy.

Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
...-tana.
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
...doing?!
You are not takin' my truck!
...town. 
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
...fine.
God-...
Ah, one of them's in the back.




...I'm not the psycho.
...I believe in live and...
I did not steal the truck.
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
Left, left, left!
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...wanna give it a try!
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!


 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
These'll keep it cold.
Yeah, he's a dangerous...


...stole the truck.
...truck.
How wonderful for you.
Robert Del Rio?
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.

...shit.
...split.
 Whoo!
Hey.   Mason.
...or my conscience.
Yeah, I know, I know.
What?
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
 That's why I didn't give it...
Go!

...on!
Oh, shit.
...our ass!
What do you think I'm doin'?!
I'm gonna kill him.
 
Forty-nine point four.



Look out.

They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Thank you very much.
No.
Be cool.  Be--
...without compunction.
Well, well, well.

...such is the price...of patriotism.

...including the permanently extreme.


I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
No, go--
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Vaughn, Burke, move to the end of the street.  Fan out and work your way back to the motel.
INT. U.S. RESEARCH LABORATORY/LONG'S OFFICE - NIGHT.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
...quick in and out.
I wanna patch in from...
What about these two?
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
 But...
Is this your establishment?
Assumptions are always dangerous.
I got someone who's anxious to talk to you, Mr. Mason.
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason.  Just give me the con-...
...and unharmed, de-...

Where's Elvis?!
Mm.  It doesn't take a genius.
EXT. DAM - DAY.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.

Who's your suspect?
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
Been trying to figure out your secret.
He's brains without ambition...
...the master of his realm.
...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
...and that power...
 ...or it'll ignite. 
Doctor.
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
We don't have an hour.  We're already supposed to be shut down.
What?
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
...-lem?
That's not the way I...
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
...stole a truck under arrest.
What happened to Colonel Brynner?

INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/BOX - DAY.

INT. TUNNEL/AIR VENT - DAY.
Well, then, how about a ruler?
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Oh yes.
That's too bad.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
When was the last time?
Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
Where is she?
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
What are you talking about?
Just bring your checkbook.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
In the garage.
Off the alley.
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it.
Who?
No. It was an accident.
I heard it was an accident.
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
What's the maid's address?
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
She's cheating on him.
Mr. Gittes.
You mean you don't know where you were?
I mean I can't tell you.
No, not for that one.
I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
Never forgave him for what?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
Know him?
Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. That's unusual.
Doing what?
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
You can't always tell what's going on there.
And I want to know where.
You mean she just found out?
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
...That's not what I meant.
I want to see her.
...so that's why you hate him...
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Oh no.
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
I cut myself shaving.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Yes?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
Comes in different parts of the river. Every night a different part.
That's a long fall.
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
But I have to know.
Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
What you find tonight on the floor between the seats? 
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
No...
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
No! You mean right at the end?  ALFREDO That's right, Toto, right at the end? And don't ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know...
You were expecting her? Huh?  ...It's a nasty business waiting by yourself. In company it's better. No?...Then I'll leave.
Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Who?
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
Thais.
Go on!
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Well, well - isn't that nice?
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Who said anything about brooms?
I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Hello, Bernstein.
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
You've got a private office here, haven't you?
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
There is no news big enough.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
But Mr. Kane, I meant -
And the notice?
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
It can wait.
Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!
No.  They've passed on.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
I mean in New York.
Can't we go back, Charlie?
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Where'm I going?
Can't say, sir.
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
I'd like that.
Charlie -
Yes?
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
She's going to leave you -
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
What do you mean by that?
You won't be lonely, Charles...
Yes.
Rawlston is my boss.
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
That must have been love.
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry?  That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry?
Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.  Go after the people that knew Kane well.  That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts -  I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -
He married you, didn't he?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
I'll have a highball.
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
I'll just take the gum.
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
There's no light back there.
I feel nauseous.
Dante. You've got a customer.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
Train. It took eight hours.
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
You work in a market, all right.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
So what are you saying?
You're such an asshole.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
No.
They certainly do. Two fifty-five.
Well, he missed!
Peptic ulcer.
Oooh! Navy Seals!
What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
You called Caitlin again?
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
Seven months.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
She called you Brad?
It takes different strokes to move the world.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
And the second time around...?
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
The best Burtless movie ever made.
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
You've got a customer.
Can we not talk about this?
We're not playing in the street.
Jesus.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
I can't close the store.
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
He made it, hunhh?
I never tried it.
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
Why should I loan you my car?
What?
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
I don't; you did.
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
I'm not. She just left.
What did she say?
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
What responsibility?
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
I'm not dealing.
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
You calling me a liar?
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
I had a friend that used to chew glass for a living. In the circus.
The white kind.
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
What were you doing up so late?
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this.
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
How many dicks have you sucked?!
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
What time do you get finished?
Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...
Veronica, I love you...
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
Scumbag. What are you doing?
He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
Does he sing in English or Russian?
Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
How long you gonna be here?
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
Fuck you.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
You're getting warmer!
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
Look, I know--
We'll never know, will we?
That's it, you look like a professional.
Don't believe it...  You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out.
I don't think you do.
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
Resuscitation?
Where?
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
And I can't leave.
He can handle it.
You mean the nerve.
Excuse me?
Don't worry about me, just go.
I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
"Time is money" -- please.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
I burned it.
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
No, he's gone.
Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.
When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
Anyone else following?
Tucker and Walker.
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
Where's the rest of the team?
Bob and Rick are in Denver.  I gotta get up there as fast as possible.  Frank, get me a load of flares.
Ask the questions.
We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
Down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die.  How's your health?
Then go fetch.
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
No names, this is an open line!
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
What did you do that for?
Doobidoob... a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A long night for growing malchicks... best not to say more. Bedways is rigthways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right.
I've been cured.
Good evening.
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Do you still feel suicidal?
Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Well - I'm back.
There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
How're you feeling this morning?
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
Vitamins will it be then?
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
Fine. Fine.
Just part of hospital routine.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Yes!!!
They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
Amen. They cross themselves.
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
Are you feeling better?
But not now?
You need a vacation.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
I don't know...
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
What thing?
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
I got my, my hands taped to the steering wheel here, there's this guy, he taped me in the car, he's back there somewhere.
Who is this?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
I'm cool.
Two...
South Central.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
You're a cabby.  Like talk yourself out of a ticket?
Jazz.  Music.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
Jazz?  That's funny, coming from you.  Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this?  I'll ask a question.
What you mean, no?
There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
Why?
It's not what you owe <u>me.</u> Time is so fleeting.  One day it's gone.  You make it out of this alive, Max, you really should call her.  That's what I think.
No, not just that.
Yeah, that.
Then what are you?
What happened to you?
Answer the question.
You turned up a one way street!
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
I think you're different.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
Yes!  Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
Switch the charts.
You switched the charts; you tell me.
For what?
I can't promise you anything.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Nothing is easy.
Do they have a secret handshake?
How'd he die?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
What?
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
Where are you?
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
Don't do this.
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
That's your option.  Ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time.  In case you didn't know it, you're crazy.
Whatever.
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
Excuse me?
The truth shall make you free.
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
And what did I say?
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
What do you suggest?
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
No, thanks.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
With me.
What?
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
Could we hear to the moon?
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
We thought this might make things a little easier.
You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
Now... you go home.
No.  Please.
A page-break signal.  A period.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
-- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission.  Heaven is the mustard seed.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
And in return?
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing.  Still, we've barely started...
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
I'm -- I'm fine.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
'My father's house has many mansions.'
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Prove it.
Some of my best friends are scientists.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
What?
I can't do this --
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
For managing the truth.  But the truth won't be managed, sir.  It stops being the truth the moment you try.
Git movin', I said.
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
Gotta go, Arletta.
Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
I don't know, Boss.
I... I... I...
Git to work!
No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more.
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
Hey, Tattoo!
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
You tryin' to say somethin'?
But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
That's it. That's the end.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
That fool. That damn fool.
That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
Well, how far didya get?
He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
Give in? That's our Luke out there.
What did I do?
Fear of what...
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
The same as the first time...
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
Ah ha.  What did he want?
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
You come and visit.
In jail.
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
Who?
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Would you want to work with us on this?
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
Work with me.
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
I want a guard on you.  I'm worried about leaving you alone.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
Because I'm all you've got.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
MaryJane.  You think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night.  I did once. But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky.  You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard.  Or the worst:  there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month.  The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark.  And then, one day, there are no more.  What happened?  Did he just stop?  Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he kill himself?  Did he die in an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or get sick and die?  It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth.  And you never know.  But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back?
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
Go and look for a note.
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
No.  I didn't.
Lieutenant  Quinn.
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
Classy madonna.
Order Chinese for us and meet me the library?  Anything but beef.
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Talk to Nikko...!
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
I know.  Get out here.
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
Helen Hudson...
What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
You got a suspect...
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
Nikko?
What!? They brought the car here?
Have you seen it?
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?
One of your suitors?
I'd like to go back. James...
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
You could get your wish at any moment.
I did this already.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
I don't think you understand.    I won't wait.
Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
What?
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
Truly.
Do you think I should?
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
You're slowing.
And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
I didn't say...
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
It's good exercise, Mom.
Yeah?
I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.
By color.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
I wish I could have seen that.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
I have a terrible confession.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
I got worried. Are you OK?
How about a dance?
Yeah, the plans.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
Well then why'd it happen?
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
Sure. Of course.
You just need to get more organized. L
Yes.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
I love him.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
You'll never get out of the city.
It's me...
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
Why are you here?
I assume you want something?
Where are you staying?
Because you're the closest.
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
No.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
Has to be.
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
Everything?
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
The Holiday Hotel.
Go where?   The police are outside.
I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.

Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
God, I want to go home.
Give it to me, Sami.
Uh huh.
Yeah, I dig him.
Feel free to correct him if you want.
Glenmorangie.
Thanks.
Tonight.
Take a nap.
Something like that.
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
A car.
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
Wait!  I'm a friend!
Why were you spying on the Yus?
This Jade Fox is a woman?
I do as I please.
Tell me, who is your master?
Let's go!
Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple.
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
He is my defeated foe!
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
You're a sword fighter too?
You're not married, are you?
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
You know about Lo?
Where is he now?
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Never!
All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
Jen!
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
Still in a bad mood?  At least you're speaking.  What's your name?
Don't ever come back.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
I knew she would intrigue you.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
Care for a hot dog?
Don't thank me.
You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
I should be trying to stop you.
How 'bout the morgue?
You're welcome.
Fun -- look at that guy...
Not me.
No.
I'd like to get in touch with him.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?
Leave me alone -- !
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Did you know Sebastian well?
I'm sure you're going to love it there.
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
From who?
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
What'cha reading?
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
Thank you.
You implied it.
Because you act like a pig.
Who?
How about tonight?
Yes.
I'm... I'm alright.
Wait, don't hang up.
Somerset Maugham.
Okay.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
Why can't we be together?
Hi.
What are you saying?
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
I'm sorry about that.
Where did you say she's from?
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
Did you hide the letters?
Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
Prude.
I know.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
Would you please leave.
You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer.
Yes.
Where is she?!
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
Ronald?
What?
Shut up and turn to page 64.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
I'll think about it...
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
I'm working on it.
Loser.
Interesting.
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
Who are you spying on?
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
She shot you down.
She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in.
Oh yes.
Tell me all the details.
It was... Fantastic.
Ronald?
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
Will you calm down?
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
You will be discreet about this?
It's the least I can do.
I'll do that.
It's really important.
I understand. Good night.
Don't worry about it.
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
How?
I suppose any note, no matter how sour, is a song if you hold on to it long enough.
But where did you get it, Amy?
At the old house with the voice.
On the back street — a green house
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
I know that.
What do you mean?
You're shouting at me.
I suppose so.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
Yes, daddy.
Did you mail then?
Certain wishes do.
And who did the voice belong to?
In the garden? Would she be there now?
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
Tell me tha real truth. You can see my friend, can't you?
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
I can not tell you.
Will you be friend for always?
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
That's right!
But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
Yes, Amy.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
Don't you hear it?
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved?
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
Your lips look delicious.
Oh, on my wrist.
Nearly four.
People notice you Frida.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
What the hell is the tampon test?
I looked like an Italian man!
You're just saying that.
Oh my god. I've never had that before. I've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said "Hey there beautiful."
It is so hot in here.
No they're not.
I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.
Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
Frida, Carlton's dead.
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
I could smell another woman on him.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
Check out what I found.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
So what do I do?
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
Uh huh. So pee.
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Yeah?
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you.
What's that supposed to mean?
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
What about... those guys... I might have...
How big?
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
She's just so... pathetic.
So now being with Frida is lucky? I thought you said she was a flake.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
And fifth, you're dating her.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
His wife.
No one available.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
I see.  One thingís for sure, heís ambitious. Youíll be a busy man from now on.
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnít with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howís your mother?
Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
I don't know who they are.
What?
This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
No...  No doctor...
A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.
Wait, this isn't fair...
No.  I mean...  that isnít necessary.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
Everyone get's one  -  very much like this...  But this one's special.  It will help you understand, everything...
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
Is this dangerous or anything?
Don't call the Vice President!
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
Exactly. A condition.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob.  He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
You can't kill a President.
Bob...
Are you threatening me?
Jesus...
The government
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
'... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
What?
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
Oh.
What about it?
Certainly.
Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!
Truman used it all the time.
I guess.
Yes.
Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it.
It was inspirational.
Yeah... Bedtime.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
It's nice.
Yeah... It could be fun.
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
We're working on it.
Leave him.
Come on.
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
You'll find the ways, Miss Mary. And when ya do...we'll sail on over to the mainland...or any other damn mainland fer that matter...and start us a recruitin' program. There's millions o' Bees out there jus' waitin' fer' a General ta lead 'em on ta vict'ry!
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
Maybe.
A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? How're you gonna leave yourself time to get out?
Come on. Let's go.
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
What'dya get?
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
But why?
Hey, this is great.
No, I've been calm all my life!  If I don't do something, it's gonna kill me.
Well?
So you really think she means you're going with her?
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  Damn it, it's gonna happen!  I feel it.  She's going to be mine!
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
This is it.
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
What's his specialty, brown-nosing?
You're welcome to join us, Todd.
I'm in.
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
I'll be there.  The Danburrys.  Friday night.  Thank you, Chris.
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
But I love you.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
A madman.
A crazy madman.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
I have something.
Okay.
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
She won't even see me, Pitts.
Then you can help him.
What?
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
It's my birthday.
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
This play?
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
The thieves.
What are those things?
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
You people...rich people...
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
You're saying they can think?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Forget them...
Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
Joey...
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again...
Where is everybody?
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
Those are mine!
Damn right!
Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.
Fuckin' A!
Who's going?
No women?
You're full of shit!
Couple of weeks... Listen --
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick!
Linda, yeah.
You call me Linda, just like home.
No.
Not bad fresh, but they don't keep worth a pig's fart.
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Oh, well...
Who's got the ammo?
Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
I don't know.
We... Three bullets.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
So do I.
What do you think about?
From Nam?
Fucking A. See that ribbon in the left. That's Quan Son. That fucking guy was at Quan Son!
Well, where's he from?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
What are you, God?
What else?
I thought you might be praying.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
Watch it, shithead!
Here! This is it!
No.
There's Albert!  Hey, Albert!!!
See you Monday.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
You didn't get a deer?
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
Yeah!
That's who.
Sure.
What'cha got, Bennett?
I want this bastard brought down.
Wade's here.
I'd think about it.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
Ah, fuck you, Wade.  This is bull- shit.  You're not going to kill me.  You're not going to risk your freedom.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
What are you talking about?
You're crazy.
<u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was on to you.  You panicked.  Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
Forget it.  Stick to the program.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
What the hell are you talking about?
Got it.  Ejection seat?
How do you know?
Trust me.  You don't want to know.
Relax, let technology do the work.
You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
I was set up.
Thanks.
Good night, Wade.
No, sir.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
...Have you been drinking?
Hospital food.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
Yeah.
Seat's too high.
Haven't seen you around.  Where have you been all my life, handsome?
From over the mountain --
No -- that's for me to do.
The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
No, thank you -- what's your name?
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
No! No! I won't.
All right, darling.
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
Thanks, Jabez -- I really wouldn't need very much ... if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting ...
What Grange?
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Afraid ... of what?
-- of what happens after we die!
Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
Leave your tongue off of that!
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
You know darn well it is.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
That's what we said.
Not all of it?
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
Mary -- how do you feel?
I'll never get my washing done.
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
Do you really think that?
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
You aren't angry with me?
-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
And now come on, Mary. I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield -- of course!
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
I can't be honest with them.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
That is Christmas music.
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
The police...?
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
I'm a cop from New York.
Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
Holly Gennero?
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
Yeah.  I remember our first date.
I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
I'm here, cowboy.
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Then this won't matter.  LAPD's not calling the shots anymore.
Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
Stand by, Powell.  I gotta check something out.
Bullshit.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is!
Come on, what's under this?
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Yeah... I know.
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
Well...
That's it.
I know!
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
Would you do something for me? Please?
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
I don't have a choice.
Look... who's on the phone?
... But you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time... You got it?  Okay?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
Sonny-boy, one word?
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
Yeah ...
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
Eugene, at 3:07, this became Federal.  Why don't I take it over now?
It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
What if I take you with me?
Wait a minute ... I've been looking at this all wrong ... Let's look at it the other way ...
You like me?
You seem like a likable enough guy. It's hard to judge.
No.  I had some legal training, but...
Okay.
I told you, he's got diabetes.
Hey.  It's raining.
It was on the TV.
Yeah.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
We won't have to.
I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
That's all they're interested in - it's a freak show to them.  I can't control it, Sal - let'em say what they want.  Forget it.  It don't matter.
I'm here.
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
I am.
Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Oh my God, mother!
I said you were never a faggot.
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
Not now, Mom, please.
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
Maybe!  Aw Christ, what dreams you live on!  Maybe what?
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
<i>That's the crew. They follow us.</i>
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
Maybe you should fuck her mom then.
Yes. <b> INT. KEG HOUSE -- CHAPTER ROOM -- NEXT </b>
Yep.
<i>The money exchange will take place at Top of the World at the Stratosphere. Get there at exactly midnight.</i>
Must you use that awful word?
He used to date Pat Benatar!
We dated off and on for two years. But life on the road is tough. The pressure of the tour... relationships within a band... sometimes it leads to jealousy.
I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.
You're wearing eyeliner. You look like a queen.
You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?
Something is going down. Something bad.
They're gonna edit it together out of sequence so it's more exciting. <b> EXT. BEVERLY HILLS -- LATER ON
Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.
We should sign her to a talent holding deal. <b> INT. KEG HOUSE -- FRANCES' ROOM -- NEXT
Real fast.
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
So?
And?
Did you ask Sal?
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
No, you the man.
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
I'm getting paid...
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
I truly hope so.  I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Señor Love Daddy's show to you.
I would like to get paid now.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
Make dat money.  Get paid.
When?
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
I can't be staying long anyway.
Then we'll do something else.
Why you gotta curse?
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan.
He's nuts.
Forget it, Mookie.
I love you.
Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
I have five kids at home, I know how it works. I'm just not "it". Okay guys? Two fifty.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
You and Lloyd chose the class!?
Ooh gross.
Okay, what?
What? No! Look.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
Probably because we've never met.
You brave soldier.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Peg leg?
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
...cause you said...
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
I bet you want your head scratched.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Hello, he only invented money!
I know I did.
Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not your tape.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league.
Special Needs class.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
Thanks, Pop.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Or maybe crossing a river!
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
Yes you are. 
Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
And...?
It's a surprise.
Just like the President.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
Yes.
Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders...
I'm sorry Gurney.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
He's hiding something.
Always?
The most lethal poison in the Universe.
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
It burns.
I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?
What is it?
MOTHER! Tell me!
Those sounds could be imitated.
It's a pleasure...
No.  I never drink -- wine.
Don't you bave a car?
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
Of course!
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
Ah!  This is very exciting.
I didn't feel well...
Let me take you to the hospital.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
After I did "Dracula," the studio offered me "Frankenstein"!  But I turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough.  It was too degrading for a big star like me.
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
WRONG!  I'm getting my first series of hormone shots!  And once those babies kick in, they're gonna remove my organs, and MAKE ME A WOMAN!
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
What do you mean?
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
Edward Wood, Sir.
H-how'd you know?!
It's that easy?
Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.
Ed, it was only one review.
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
I told you this was gonna happen.
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.
Yeah.  Exactly!
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
Absolutely!  You see this script..?
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
So you're not gonna make the movie?
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
The marriage already ended.
I just picked them up on the way over...
They're very nice.  Let me get my coat.
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
Who's Dr. Tom?
My chiropractor!
C'mon!  Let's just go.
Yes?
Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it!
What's uncanny?
Well it looks good.  Let's use it!
Nah, it'll work.  Where's Bela?
YES!  JUST DO IT!
So how long have you known Eddie?
I do.
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
Look at your face. I had a car that color.
They celebrated the common person.
Al!!
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
I want you to take this.
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
Uh-huh?
Great line.
Ed, do you want my advice?
Ed --
Good luck.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
Al!
No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
When? Today?
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No. It's a mess.
Both.
He says --
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
She had white shoes.
What's the difference?
What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...
St. Joseph's.
So you had sex with him?
I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
Well, when will she be back?
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
All right. Let them decide.
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
I batted!
Well, then I'm quitting.
Okay ...
Can't we just --
Why?
Everybody hates me!
Look at this.
What are you drunk?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
What...
What?... Why?
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
What is? Oh, dinner!
How?
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
Good luck, Tracy.
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
I'm looking at new cars.
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Sporty.
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
I hope so
Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
This weekend.
Should we get a what?
Yeah.  I'm here.
Sherry... I love you.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
But other people can see them too.
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
Tell me about Patchett.
I'm not sure.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
How?
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
Yeah, so...
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Man, what're you saying?
I don't own no shotguns.
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
But you were business associates?
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.
Something like that.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
A vulgar term, but yes.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
Really?  What did White say?
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
Why?
You sound like you mean it.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
Jack!  It's Christmas!
No.  No, I've heard bupkis.  Jack, I'll talk to you later.  Call me when you get something I can use. Smut's from hunger.  For sad sacks who can't get their ashes hauled
What's he doing here, Sid?
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
What happened with the kid and Loew?
Please hold, Sergeant...
Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
Really?  How?
Someone else?
I don't know what that means.
Turn on CNN.
When can you get it here?
Be careful, Danny.
Yes.
Who was that other guy?
The NSA?
Okay.
It's a SAT-tracker.
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury.  And take this.
What'd I tell you?
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
I didn't use my name.
Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
Them.
Those are Feds.
Tell me about it.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Goddammit--
So what do we do now?
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
Oh my God.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
Your stuff?
A report?
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
No, sir.
Uh-oh.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
Oh, please--
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
Stacy--
That's okay.
Oh Christ.
It's over.
You did good.
It is fish.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Do you like fish?
When do I get to meet him?
DePinto?
So you've said.
Other than Brill.
All right, look--
Will you hang on just a second.
That's temporary.
I'm sorry about that.
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
Merry Christmas, son.
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Hi, dad.
Can I open 'em up?
Where's mom?
She's in the kitchen.
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
Usually they take clothes.
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
Listen to me.
Tell me about it.
Are you okay?
Yes. But we can't.
Because we, and our associates, have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you, <u>because</u> of shyster lawyers like you, and we'd just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass-banged by as many people as possible.
What?
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
There was a transfer.
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Yes sir.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
What about the tape?
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
What kind of fossils?
Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
You felt obliged to.
You sing.  All the time.
Ask Al Auf. Almásy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
No, but I think I do.
Will you please come in?
I believe you still have my book.
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
What do you hate most?
It's a folk song.
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
Yes.  A different wife.
Don't do this.
It hurts too much.
What?
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
Her hands and feet were tied.
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
I told you so.
When's Clifton picking you up?
Okay.
I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
Don't cut me.  Come on.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
She can take you as far as Florence.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
What did you say?
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
No, now I can't kill you.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure…
Yes.  Dropping off.
He's Canadian.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Your friend?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
Why?  Is he staying?
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
So one day we'll meet.
No.  He's - no.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
A more modest expedition, or even wait a year.  Remind our families we still exist.
Why not?
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
I'll come with you.
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
Exactly.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
Which you have in mind.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
No you can't.
Then don't.
I'll call an ambulance.
It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit.
I sincerely hope so.
Of course I can. I have a note from mother.
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
But--
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
I never carry...baggage.
Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad.
This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
We are...for the tools.
Our equipment has arrived.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
One more item--not on the check list.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
To our...partnership.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
It's a party.
Ready.
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
A parting gift from the Empire.
That's where the Mask comes in.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.
Packed.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
That's because you grew up rich.
They'll each be positive the other guy did it.  I fear an ugly international incident.
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
Always in a rush.
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Suspicious, after all these years?
She's calling the shots now.
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
I been meaning to tell you, far as I'm concerned you're over the hill.
Don't use language with me --
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
What's your point?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
Yeah.
Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
Good.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
And you can't?
Erin --
-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it.
Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
They skipped that step.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
<u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
Bullshit.  You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me.  After all I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.
Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
Uh-huh.
So why would PG&E offer it?
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
I was wrong.
Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  Give him another chance.
That's right.
You come to the right place.
There's more than one kind?
I'm gonna hate it.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
Thanks for reminding me.
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
Right, I guess those are the kids --
Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say they both have some form of cancer.
Much anger in him, like in his father.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
I'm going to see what it is.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Han, we need you here.
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
Forget it.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
No lightspeed?
You look great.
Hyperdrive.
Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
I didn't say anything?
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
Jabba the Hutt?
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
I thought I was in good shape.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
That they are.
But tell me why ...
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
What d'you mean, pretending? They are dressing.  Where'd they get those clothes?
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
I'm a psychiatrist.
C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
We'll see.
I thought he was, but he came back.
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
All right, so I made another deal.
I got a new deal for you.
What's the little black box do?
A medical team will be standing by.
Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.
No way.
Later.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
Are you crazy?
No screamin' shit.
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
Find Cuervo Jones.
Move aside!
And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
It is deep...
But not from your destiny.
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
What book is that?
I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There.
You freed it, son?
Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
Because you and the land are one.
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
It is.
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him.
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Fuck it.
I see, your excellency.
And you got an invitation.
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
What didn't he tell you?
Didn't who tell me?
It's serious?
Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
How are you today?
That's good.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
Oh yeah, since when?
It's fine really, sit.
No
What kind of stuff?
When can I have one?
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
Cause I like it.
Oh I love you.
Your not gonna marry him are you?
Do you not like him like daddy?
St. Mike's.
Damien Karras.
That's good.
What we missed in the EEG and the arteriogram could conceivably turn up there. At the least, it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
You just missed them.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
Uh Huh.
In time.
La plume de ma tante.
Uoy era ohw.
No.
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
And let my cry come unto thee.
Defender of the human race...
No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer.
Always.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Unlikely.
No I probably wouldn't.
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
O'Lord hear my prey.
Fuck him!!!
How old are you?
If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
Give me the keys.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
They're falling out.
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
What's wrong with the kid?
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Lotta water.
Count the fucking money, Frank.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
Cindy.
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
Funny.  Strike a bell?
Your older brother.
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
It's not family.  It's business.
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
Let's get it over with.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
Come on, stand still.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
You recognized me.
Last?
Sunday.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
Yeah.  You mind?
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
No. Why?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
How come I didn't hear anything?
Couple years.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
I can't make the tenth.
Cancel, Frank.
Twenty-eight years.
What's it for?
You don't know?
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
Later.
Sure.
No.
Good choice.
Yeah?
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
The audience was a little off tonight.
I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.
Yes, it is.
What do you mean?
You're an hour and a half late.
When we know.
What I mean is --
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
Where's your dress?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Piece of cake.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Did you hear it?
Virgins.
Virgins?
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
Well then ... shall we?
Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
Huh?
Yes, well, they are.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
Will I see you again?
Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?
And you don't?
His kid's sick.
The Stratford.
You're upset.
All I said was you were good.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
So, what happened?
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
Hi.
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
Good to see you, Ma.
Oh, fine.
None?
You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
Yeah -- me.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
No.
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
What more proof do you need?
Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.
Jon, what is it?
Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex?
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
It can't be.  It's impossible.
Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
Not if I kill you first ...
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
What's that?
What do you know about it?
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
Gone?
Call me spontaneous.
Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
Oh, that Karl.
Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
So you left her?  Just like that?
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
What’s going on here?
That’s right.  Okay, let’s make a quick stop at the kids’ shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then I’ll run into the linen store...
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Maybe I don’t say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  You’re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
I don’t care if you’re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can’t park here.
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
Damn, you are the real thing...
A lucky streak, huh?
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
Why not?
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
C’mon, Jack...
What're you talkin' about?
You’re a nurse?
All in one tape?
Right, for us. But...I’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
Jack...don’t even start...
Telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
I’m working on a new deal now...
Look at me like you haven’t seen me every day for the last twelve years...
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
Maybe you’re not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldn’t need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if that’s what it’s gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids’ college fund.
I think it worked out okay, don’t you?
Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, where’s that chocolate cake...?
Wait a minute.  You’re my wife?
It’s wonderful...
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
Promise me again...
Don’t get on that plane!
You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
A shelter?!  I’m the richest guy in the building...I’ve got twice the square footage you have!
Do I know you?
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
So we'll get egg nog.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Am <u>I</u> okay?!  You wanna explain that?!
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
What do you mean "complete"?
I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --
Ben, are you there?
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
Showtime.
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
Not at all.
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Which was?
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
Just <u>find</u> him.
Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
Here's the Surgeon.
Trip? Where to?
As part of the Crew.
Yes?
He's blanked out on that one particular point.
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
Nothing -- against all that force.
I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise.
What's that?
No, there's no other way.
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
You have no right to blame Duval --
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
Sort of.
That makes two of us.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
May I have your ticket, please?
What?
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
My wife! What the - how's -
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
What the heck d'ya mean?
Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand.
Yah, but this TruCoat -
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.
Yah, he -
Where'd you get him that parka?
Yah, got a front movin' in.
In what way?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Yah.
Yah, that can happen.
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
No. No, ma'am.
No, I -
We run a pretty tight ship here.
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Sir? Right now?
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
Yah, how much money was that?
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Yah!
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
...Yah.
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Whatcha watchin' there?
Yah.
Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. It's my show here.  That's that.
Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
Well, they're a good outfit.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
I always liked ya so much...
Yep.
Now, I saw some rough stuff on your priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide...
Norm?
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
There's the car! There's the car!
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
No, no.
Yah.
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Yah. Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call.  In the meantime, don't leave town.  I may need to bring you in for questioning.
Go ahead.  I'll expose you.
Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.
You can't have the whole brain!
The girl had done her homework.
Really?
I'm just on my way out...
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
I don't know ...
Here.
Chloe's dead.
When?
I don't know.
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
Tyler?
Well... let me see... here's the thing...
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Who do you think I am?
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
You're a tourist.  I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
Tyler Durden.
No, supply oxygen?
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
I don't follow...
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
What fight?
Alive or dead?
Any historical figure.
He was obviously able to handle it.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
Okay.
Promise?
Guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
This isn't possible...
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
You took me to the house.
Why what?
I'm doing this for us.
You will.  You know you will.
What?
Very good, Sir.
There is no money.
Ain't that something?
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
No, please, no, God, no!
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
What list?
Signs?
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
He probably already knows we're coming.
Taken care of.
Yeah, you should have specified.
I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
Yeah, so what happened?
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
Do you remember what triggered it all?
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
I'm not following you --
I know how it feels to be dead.
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
I can live with thaaaa --
Would you take these?  And if I die...  Could you throw all my drugs out? Paraphernalia, porno, you know... Anything that would break my mom's heart.
What feeling?
I know, we'll be there soon.
You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
No! No! Don't!
Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
"Next?"
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
Design?
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
Terry's name should be on this wall.
Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.
Read you.
There are no worse places.
Why's that?
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
I couldn't get you in.
Let's get that tent down!
What's the job?
Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be walking funny.
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
Hard to believe.  You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken.  No sense of humor.  What did you expect?  An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?
You're not.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Well, there's nobody special!
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
Yeah!
Most men are.
Why this is outrageous!...
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.
And who's Lydia?
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
I... You're not going to understand this.
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
How have you been?
Yeah, Edwin, <u>sure</u>... and <u>Pinnochio</u> is a true story... <u>Edwin!  Wake up!</u> This is a fairytale...
She <u>likes</u> me.  She said for me to call!
Come on now...You can't sit here.
Leave me alone...I wanna go...
You can ask.
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
My name is Parry.
Where -- ?
Sshhhh!
Parry.
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.  This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
It sounds exciting.
I don't drink coffee...
I don't drink coffee...
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
You're married.
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
A wig?
Well, lemme play the other side then.
No, dammit, I would easy.
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
You just going to sit there?
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
Now, hand...
Sure...
Where are you going?
How do you know it's clean?
Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
Would you like to talk to the manager?
Don't, then.
Oh.
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
What?
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
Uhm hmm.
What?
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
I guess you fell in the water.
Swimming?
What would I do with it? Run amok?
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
Yes, that's what's important to me...
I'll be back later...
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
That'll make you happy.
I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
What?
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
Jesus, what a rude person...
Steam.
There's some good things on it, though.
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
Hurry up, you're wastin' my time, what the fuck.
Wussup.
Remember me, from the pool?
Um. Yeah! Shorty!
A play-ya.
I kissed those girls.
She fucks it all up!
C'mon.
You know, Eddie's cousin.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Hey!
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
Nineteen.
Fletch, this is dumb.
You don't have to run with me, Crease.
Full name.
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
Ask anybody.
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
That's two.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Just relax....
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
Like when?
Fletch...
You don't know me.
I'm serious, Sam.
Right. Fine.
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
'...with his legal wife, the former Sally Ann Cavanaugh.'
Well, I'm fully covered.
Right.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
Who?
I'm all ears.
So why pick me?
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
You sure got the hard part.
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Don't say shoot, okay.
No, thank you.
Preoccupied with what?
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
No. He was. I got him out.
Depends on the question.
Are you still in love with Alan?
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
How come?
But I've seen the deed.
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
I checked. There was no divorce.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Come here.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Very good, sir.
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
What?
Lock's busted.
What?
I commend him on his choice
Who are you?
And a damn fine one, I might add.
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
Not really.
I was upset.
Who's Frieda?
In a minute!
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Right away!
You're saying you need money.
Cool.  Jazz, meet me at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion tonight. I'll have a ticket for you at the door.  Some concert.  Could be interesting.  Dress nice.
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
Three hundred.
Hey, they blew me.
It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Forget it.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.
Like me.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
Golly, I'd probably faint.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
'Bye, Johnny...
What?
Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money.
What?
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Pour moi?
We must follow it.
He is not wrong.
Who financed it?
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
How'd I know he had a knife.
Whip it out.
Policy man in Queens.
I can't.
You remember Mary Finelli?
What I know is what I told you.
Nothing.
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
Don't know what's behind it.
Hey, bud.
I'd go with you and Chinese take-out over her any time.
He did.
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
Frank...
Luck, my ass.
About what?
How's that?
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
What'd you say your name was?
I'm not dreaming.
What?
Johnny...?
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
But you're not...you're not still here.
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
October 12, 1969.
What, Johnny?  What is it?
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
Something happened, something...
She's not here.
No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
Hang on.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
Yeah.  That's it.
Look who's talking.
Fuck you, asshole.
Same thing.
Cool it, Andy.
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
I vote for the hammock.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Be a man, man.
Your bed.
Nothing.
Did you stay here last night?
My whole world.
May be please have the wallet.
Stop worrying.  I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
I never said you were "nothing".
Who's Horace?
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Better call an ambulance first.
Happy Friday the 13th.
Sheriff, you better take this.
My ass.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
Nancy.
Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember?  This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?...
All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
Boy scouting.
Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
Save your...
I need to talk to you.
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
So's he and he knows it.
Good night, beautiful.
Get up!
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
That's all right.  I was just...
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Randy, c'mon!
Have a good night.
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
Are you crazy?!
I've told you the truth.
You don't know shit!
About what?
She did!
Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
I mean really never.
I'm literally going to kill you!
I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
But...wait a minute!
Right.
The fire alarm...
They're out of town.
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
Oh dear God...
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
Just felt a little chill.
No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The ship's only so big and there's certainly no way off it, is there?
Yeah...a lot.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
What about you?
The window...
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
I'm not!!
Where you're going, mister?
Very big.
Very bad today.
That's where I peed.
Alla puttanesca.
Shut up, Elliot.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Tonight. What's tonight?
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
You say we go?
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
It's your best play, Nicky.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
What?
What do you mean?
Our Peter?
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
We're able to surprise each other.
In and out of bed.
We don't even like each other, do we?
I go to college. I thought you knew.
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
Except I won't have a father anymore.
This building is not secure.
What do we want?
Mystery. Deception.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
Washed away.
I'm at the door.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
Yes.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
Oh. You know him.
So do I. Over and over.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
The fact is, I have to get going.
Is it true?
He's a very sweet man.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
All the more reason.
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
Some of it good, I hope.
Well, we shall try.
What was he like?
No, no -- just a moment, please.
Panditji -- please, help me.
I hope not.
Even as a boy I thought so.
My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
I would rather march.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
Thank you. No.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
Who are you trying to convince?
Not yet, I'm afraid.
I'll see what I can do.
A man's dead, Detective.
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
--What <i>about</i> his profile?
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
Where did you get this?
What a relief.
He's too tall.
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
German.
Noone orders southpaws anymore.
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
They found my eyelash.
Could be worse.  They could have found it in your eye.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
Will you be okay?
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
How do I square the accident?
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
Why would we do that?
In the South Wing.
I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here.
Of course.
Who are they?
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
Not so long--just once around the sun.
Antonio--
This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
Stay clean.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
Get it over with...
I've been there every day for the last four years.
Good.
Really.
For exits off Main Street.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
When are you going to learn?
Listen to me. It's hard enough.
You want to try with me?
Just get your clothes on...
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Yeah. I got out.
What's it to you?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
That's what I want.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
Go with God.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
Nothing. What could I do?
Yeah.
Well?
I made a mistake.
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
What about?
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Yes, I do.
Sid Fletcher.
Yes.
Nasty.
Yeah.
Expect so.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
You coming to South America?
Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
Las Vegas.
Four of them.
It's not like that, luv.
You don't look it.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?
You wouldn't.
What's that supposed to mean?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
How could I stay away?
Meaning what?
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Scotch, please.
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
Yeah.
I have to. Things to see to.
Shut up.
No.
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
...Polacks...
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
To get on the...
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
Well, I think I had one once.
What?
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
I, I...I...
I...
...that's right...
Yes.
No.
Yes...?
How?
What? 
What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
You haven't talked to him.
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
Yes.
No.
Hey.
We are?
Is that what I said?
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
So I'm making it concrete.
Is that what I just said?
I do?
Because you listened.
What do you care...?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... 
Thieves.
Go to lunch, will you...
Did they get my contracts?
Levene!
Levene!!
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
...then...
All that I'm saying...
...you talk to Murray...
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
They all kick out.  You run in streaks, pal.  Streaks.  I'm... I'm...don't look at the board, look at me.  Shelly Levene.  Anyone. Ask them on Western.  Ask Getz at Homestead.  Go ask Jerry Graff. You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT. I got to get on the fucking board. Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who ever picked up a check I was flush. Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch himself...Those guys lived on the business I brought in.  They lived on it...and so did Murray, John. You were here you'd of benefited from it too.  And now I'm saying this.  Do I want charity?  Do I want pity?  I want sits.  I want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  Give me a lead hotter than that, I'll go in and close it.  Give me a chance. That's all I want.  I'm going to get up on that fucking board and all I want is a chance.  It's a streak and I'm going to turn it around.  I need your help.
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
Because I say so.
What does that fucking mean?
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
Excuse me...
How do you know I made it up?
I...
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
I've got the check...
Fuck you.
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
Mmmm...
I don't know.  For me, I'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm.  Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. There was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me café au lait.  She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.  Eh?  What I'm saying, what is our life?  It's looking forward or it's looking back.  And that's our life. That's it.  Where is the moment?  And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss.  What else?  The bank closes.  We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? None on 'em.  We worry anyway. What does this mean?  I'm not secure.  How can I be secure?  Through amassing wealth beyond all measure?  No.  And what's beyond all measure?  That's a sickness. That's a trap.  There is no measure. Only greed.  How can we act? 
James.  I'm glad to meet you.  I'm glad to meet you, James.  I want to show you something.  It might mean nothing to you...and it might not. 
Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
I don't understand.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
The check wasn't cashed?
I just called downtown, and it's on their desk.
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
I can't talk to you, you met my wife, I...
What did I tell you?  What did I say about the three days...?
What are the police doing here...?
Guess who?
You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?
Have a good trip.
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
They--excuse me...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
Patel?  Fuck you.  Fuckin' Shiva handed him a million dollars, told him "sign the deal," he wouldn't sign.  And Vishnu, too.  Into the bargain.  Fuck that, John.  You know your business, I know mine. Your business is being an asshole, and I find out whose fucking cousin you are, I'm going to go to him and figure out a way to have your ass... fuck you--I'll wait for the new leads.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
Yes.  Please.  Please.  The police  can be...
Your contract went out to the bank.
I can help you.
Well, that's alright... alright. Good.  You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right?  You know... I never finished college.  I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
She couldn't decide.
What if we don't pay?
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
The children can stay.
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
 You're a good fellow.
Yeah, some deal I made.
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
No.
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
And you believed that story.
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
How long does this go on?
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
I don't know.  I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
Will you tell him?
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
They are everywhere!
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
Very well.
He is, I believe, a brother.
If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
But times are different...
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
Except the President of the United States.
I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
Very impressive.
When do we talk?
After dinner.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
You were unfair with them.
I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
Turnbull is a good man.
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
The same assurance we got from you.
What about Michael Corleone?
I didn't mean to...
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
Of course.  I am married still.
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
You went to university?
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
Go ahead.
Yes.  An old, useless friend.  You must excuse me, Mr. Boone.  This is a world I finished with long ago. I pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment.  Lunch should be ready.  Shall we?
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
I never thought you were.
What happened?
The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed.
You first.
Not me.
Something happened to him?
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
Do I look okay?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.  I believe I promised you some clothes.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
A very lucky thing indeed.
Not at all.
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
Oh no, my friend.  It's digging itself up.  There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.  All my diversions have abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading. Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone to me now.
Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
No.  But someone you can talk to.
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
One likes to live simply.
I know.  People's movies aren't their lives.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
Then the rumors are true?
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ...
How is he?
The other day....
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
You seem a little hinked-up ...
Got it ...
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
It's all microchips and shit ...
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
It's arright ...
one minute -- !
How's Kip?
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
What do you say, Toby?,
I'm cool -
Yeah... You want a ride...
Just hold on... Hold on ...
Yeah --
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
I can handle it --
Me.
You?
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
Shadow games ...
After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
Come here -
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
Where we going -- ?
You look like you lost your sheep ...
On account of me.
The right side of the engine is running richer than the left. And the scope isn't showing shit... I dunno...
No ...
Oh, yeah.
No. Open her ...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Let me worry about The Club ...
How is he -- ?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
She left...
All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
Not really --
Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
Son of a bitch. Get over here.
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
With what?
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
Nah.
How?
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
He heard.
You're some fucking jerk.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
There's a shovel at my mother's.
So do I.
Okay?
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
Please?
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
Next week.
I don't know.
Gone.
Some shows are worth the price of admission, partner.
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
Why didn't you yoke him?
Oh...
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
You could put a pool in that backyard.
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
Oh, Morgan.
Retainer...
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
You don't have to be nervous, Will.
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
No students work for me.
Hey fuck you.
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
--that?--
I don't know what it's called.
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
Thank you, Will. I'll do that.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
Good to see you.
That would be fine.
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
Jobs doing what?
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
Einstein. Had two marriages, both train-wrecks. The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum--
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
Why there?
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
He was my roommate in college.
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
Have you read all these books, Will?
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
Tell me what you really think.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?
I don't know.
So Christ, call her up.
Yeah.
What?
Not to me, they're not.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
I didn't ask for this.
You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.
Look at me. What do you want to do?
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
You're Welcome, Will.
What?
Okay, sounds good.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
Sure.
Okay...
No I wasn't...
Not a chance.
Do you keep in touch with them?
You should have called. I have an "O- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible.  It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look:
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
They don't come over here that much.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
I guess so.
Then what are you afraid of?
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
What am I scared of?
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
I'll get Rosasharn.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
People done it. If they could, we could.
I guess that's what he looked like.
Sure, but what is this?
Women?
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Joad. Tom Joad.
I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
Anything like work aroun' here?
I ain't no preacher anymore.
All right, you remember the *man* then.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles.
Thought you was in jail.
I aim to.
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
Oh!
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
Sure. We made a buck since midday.
All but me! I'm a-stayin'.
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
I like the tent better.
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
Don't taste bad.
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Forget it, Ma. Jus' think about the nice things out there. Think about them grapes and oranges--an' ever'body got work--
No.
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
They know he got hit in the face.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
Are you crazy?
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
California, here we come!
Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus' don't cry. 
Won't they ketch us?
I never--
You people looking for work?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Yes I do.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
Really...? So what?
Then express yourself, Bob.
I'm a professional killer.
Okay.
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Yep.
Bad experiences.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Unbelievable.
What?
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
Could be. The physical substance of love.
You never could have kept this from me.
Will you come with me?
What if I come back?
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
I just know.
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
I work alone.
It's only natural....
Hello Martin. How have you been?
In Portugal, yes.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
I'll do it tomorrow.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
I've looked at it.
It's a place where religious people--
You have a headache?
I have a headache. You have a headache?
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
You're leaving me hanging here...
To shoot you. Correct.
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Five years. My son was born here.
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
How did you find out all that?
Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
Tom.
What?!
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
Fine!
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
I don't care.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Little.
You already did.
Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
Well, now you know what it feels like.
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
What?... Oh baby...
Who's there?
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Tch. What are you --
Do you? Do you really?
Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Everything all right.
About what?
I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare.
What do you mean?
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
Oh, I don't know...
No. He had the choice.
What choice!!?
It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
I was there for that shot, actually.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Yes, it does.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
Promise?
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Frank's touchy about his cousins.  Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
There's no hurry. Take you time.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
I just could never say it!
I'm okay... I'm okay.
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
What stuff is that?
Don't move!
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
I want it.
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Difficulty rating?
Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
No. No one special.
Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late.  And would you try and please fill these out?
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
What's going on?
Fucked if I care, man.
We did it!
Think you can do better?
Yeah?
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
Okay, thank you.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
What?
I'll make it up to you!
Yeah.
Wanna go for a swim?
Homicidal?
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson is working really hard. We got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. I think we've got a hacker.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
When did you find this out?
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
Okay, I guess. I'll call you later.
It's okay..it's okay.
Because the lights are all out.
About what?
It's been eleven months.
In a second.
I thought you said you were ready.
Oh Rachel!
Then we'll be safe?
All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
Hi Jamie.
You won't look pushy.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
He's here, Sheriff.
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
He's been here.
Least I'm not alone.
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Sort of.
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Okay.
What?
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
I forgot my chemistry book.
Why did you hang up on me?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
I wasn't spooked.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
No, he's not.
Are you sure?
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
Okay. Later.
There WAS.
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
Yes.
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
Yeah.
Well, let's do it.
Yeah.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
But I'm seeing him.
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Is this your first job?
What makes you think we're more interesting?
I'm an architect.
Yes.
Yeah.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
When did you first notice this?
Could you--
...with the affiliates.
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
...cannot go on the air.
I don't know exactly.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
No?
Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Oh, that's nice.
He's got like six gold records.
Did you ever read this one--?
Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.  I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
Oh, all the time.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
That's where your talent lies.
Mmm.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Are you angry with me?
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
I'm saying it now!
Yeah...but you're not dying!
I'm okay.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Is there no chance?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Really?
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
Yeah.
I hope.
But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
Well-well, like what?
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
I was so bored!
Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
I'm fine.
...namely a personality.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Nobody ever said it.
Really?
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
I'm going to tell you later....
A reward for what?
Orderly.
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
We could skip the Gavotte.
Then who's buying it?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
They got that kind of money?
Their family owns...
Why did he come back?
Seen what, sir..?
Show me the Pigs.
Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
I like Popcorn...
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
Starling...?
...what'm I looking at...?
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
I'm an orphan.
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
Where do you live?
No. 
You were given backup....
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
...but will that satisfy you?
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
What would you guess, Ardelia?
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Why?
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
"A liaison position with the Opera." 
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
Say Hi for me.
Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
You guys have been so colossal...
I'm not a nai-ive little...
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--

Nice guys finish last. I should know.
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
Oh yeah, that's it.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
Heather? Wha...
What do you want from me?
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
Yeah, great.
Chick-en.
Like a suicide thing?
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, <u>Dad</u>?
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
You must have had fun.
Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
Don't <u>even</u> talk about that stuff!
Let's kick his ass.
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
Answer him dick!
Superb.
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary.

I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.

I just want to be on my own for a while.

I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
stands and walks toward the door.
That's enough, Yvonne!
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
He . . .
Yes . . .
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
Okay so... what's the safest place?
Second most common?
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Getting paid for doing shit.
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
I've been in here before.
Where's Allison?
How do you think you got this job, cock?  Mmm. I'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim.
Gwen, my wife's dead.
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Where's my wife?
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
Can you follow them?
Well now there's a compliment.
WHAT?!
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
I got your bail continued.
Mister LaPlante...
Business thing.  Gimme a seven and seven, willya?
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
Bill, listen...
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
Were you in it?  In the war?
...unworthy of the adoration.  We all do.
There, like that.  Kind of, uh, sexy.  You can support me anytime, John.
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?
You wouldn't push the guy, would you?
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Quit?  She wants to quit?
She can't quit.
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
Helluva story!
I... I saw him out the window.
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
Any particular brand?
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
-- hospital.
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Sure.
It's a living.
About us.
A man scared me.
Holly -- that's not so.
I've asked him what's wrong.
Don't drive yourself crazy.  It's probably nothing.
He'll never appreciate it more.
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
What?
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Fuck you, Philip.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
This is my house.
Just reduced.
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
Can we keep him?
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.
He had to come from somewhere.
I think it was England.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
Indeed you did.  And now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.
What?
Sing.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
Maybe myself.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
What worries you?
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
No -- after you.
I think you just like to eat dirt.
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Why are you doing this?
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
In the highlands?
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
I'll be fine.
Because it's my name.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
I'm interested in mythology.
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
Conner?
What's that next to him?
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
The mother is in Florida visiting her sister.  The father works at home, so he's probably inside.
I guess so.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
Keep trying.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
I understand.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.
What are you talking about?
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
They're fine.
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
My father.
Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!
Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC.  Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier.
I don't eat junk food.
What do you mean?
You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
Be quiet!  Listen!
Mine, too.
Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
How can we get out?
Another minute.  Please --
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
Go, Chief.
I know the one.
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
Goddamned small town bullshit.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Go, Mickey.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
Special Agent Jones.
Not until the man calls.
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
Who is it?
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
You can let go.
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
Excuse me?
Of course.
We are looking for you.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Ten thousand francs for each one.
How many in your family?
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Excuse me, Colonel.
Satellites?
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.
No.
Listen, you need me.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
What is it?
You’re drunk.
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
When will they be here?
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Can we phone them in, Paul?
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
I will give you my house.
Also, this is your bill for the last week.
Of course.
Please, be quiet.
I couldn't help.
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Where are you hurt, son?
No, Odette says he's in shock.
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
What?
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
It was substantial.
I want to know.
No! Sit down now.
How dead?
What! Paul storms off.
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
Thank you, Roger.
I'm confused.
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
-- bullshit --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Oh dear.
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
Nothing.
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Poor Mr. Price --
-- yeah, we did that --
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
Everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned. There are five of us...
Run.
I don't do groups.
So where's the party?
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
Haven't they already?
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
I know.
-- in the act.
-- and who's next on your list?
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
My wife. Where were we?
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
I remember...it was a long time ago...my father said: when the House was finally completed, make sure...we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne- that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere!
Something with the power, I don't know!!
-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War.
Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.
Excuse me?
You say you saw some activity here?
We don't have proof of that.
Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
I don't understand.
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
Where is she?
She's here.
Take me to her.
He's blessing the house.
Why?
Good night daddy.
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...
Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
Oh come on!
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
What's happening!
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
You'll have to settle for turkey.
Did you know her very well?
Good night.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!
I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
Runic?
Jesus Christ ...
Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
Oh yeah ...
I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them.
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love boiling water.  It's a specialty of mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Would you know this store again?
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
No.  Thank you.
Fuck you!
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
Oh, I don't ...
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
Rutherford Auction... that name...
Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  "Witchcraft." What's the running time?
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
"Maybe we're ragged and funny."
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
Ooh-kay...
Anna, what are you trying to say...
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
Question, sir?   His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank.
Oh, you read that.
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
Wha--
Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
This is too bad to be false.
And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it?
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
For God's sake, chain this convict.
Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit, I'm involved in this thing, so I just wanna know what this thing is. I wanna be treated as an adult.
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
If you do anything to my friend...
The Jerky Circle!
The Hudsucker Hoop!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
Cheap! Cheap! It's never been more valuable! And I'm ruined! Ruined!
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
Now, Aim --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Now, Aim --
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
Phony, huh?
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
Says who?!
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Well, why don't ya read it.
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
Yeah?
Wait a minute!
You're fired.
But, sir!
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
If you say, miss.  If you say.
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
But, Mrs. Rand --
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
My brother's wife.
It'll wait.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
Of course not!
Good morning.
Didn't I?  I don't know.  That's the simple truth of it.  I don't know.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
You were possessed.  That is true -- possessed by your subconscious mind.  You were in the Houmfort, surrounded by their symbols.  To them, nothing worse can happen to a person than to be made into a Zombie.  Your subconscious mind used their own words for evil.
Technical responsibility, real responsibility -- what difference does it make?  Jessica lives -- or she dies. That's what we're talking about!
What about her?
Investigation of what?
In other words, I'm on trial.
To the asylum?
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.
What do you think?
So early?
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Stuffed and baking.
You go dry off now.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
It's a starting place.
If you're going to insult me --
What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
That this was going to be a key party?
Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
We're not going anywhere.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Paul? Yeah. You think --
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
I'm fine dad.
Yeah.
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
I just can't believe you could be so --
Nah.
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
Of course.
With Mikey?
You're not a psycho!
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
I used to know how to cook.
How'd you know?
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
Ouch.
The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick.
Where you going?
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
What do you mean?
One for you and one for me.
Just be careful.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
My what?
Who said so?
Tell Sandy? What?
Huh?
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
No.
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
Huh?
That's all, for now.
Don't worry about him...
Yeah.  All over.
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
What I saw?
You know what about.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
What did he look like?
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
You're not missing much.
That's what I said.
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
Thought you might find that.
Yes down at the station.
I suppose.
Did you have sex with her?
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
Congratulations.
There's nothing more to talk about.
Don't you pull that shit with me.
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
You're not following procedure.
Drop the gun, Walter.
But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
Perhaps...
Then God does not exist...
No, my beloved, my child.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
How he must have loved you.
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
What night? What do you mean?
But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
No. Laudanum.
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
Don't mock, Claudia...
Yes.
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
But why do you want me?
Dying?
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
I can't.
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
NO!!!
THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
I didn't want to kill her.
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
You have it...
You followed me here, didn't you?
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
The story about stakes through the heart?
You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
I've got to see.
What do we do?
I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise.  Wanna dance?
I'm sorry.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
It's in my room!
Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Rio, baby!
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
Why?
I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
In case you do so, would you --
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
Good winds and bad winds!
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
In the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others.  Let them think it was a normal  And, perhaps it was —- perhaps it was.
Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
Sleep well.
Closer and closer —- until they bite into your throat!
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
They shall not hurt you
What an odd question!
She is dead — at peace.
Whet do you mean?
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ——young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
What if he is?
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
What is her illness?
Why -- no not before Thea came ——
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ——
The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
How did she die?
I don' t know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back ——pale -- sick -- she died --
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
Well, tell, him.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
I can't do that. These families have children.
Don't . . . George?
Yeah, very funny.
Made what?
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
Zuzu's petals.
Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
Who is it?
George Bailey.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
Oh, look at this. Champagne!
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Uh-huh.
You're not paid to be a canary.
No.
Okay.  What's yours?
Look, Nick. What's wrong?
What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
How's that?
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
Very funny. Very funny.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
How do you do.
The whole town's gone crazy.
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
This way.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .
Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?
Well, I don't.
Me?
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Hi.
What plates?
Well, I don't know....
You bet.  Hang on....
Anyone got another set of sails?
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Oh.
What camera?
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
You can't stop me.
Please.  It's my job.
Hey -- you can't do that.
Do I have to?
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
I'll be careful.  I'll see y'later.
You heard me.
Yeah?
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
You said something about a camera.
What else you got?
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Okay, okay -- stand over there....
All of us thank you, okay?
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
The Shark's mouth.
Sound?
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Late.
I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
I did, I did.
Santos' place.
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
Sean's asleep.
Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
What?
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
That's you.
I'm not crazy about blind dates.
I will, I will.
Great.
Maybe.
Okay, okay, coming....
Me neither.
3:30.
With you, everything's next week. I want to go skiing soon.  Tomorrow?
Give me back my hat!
It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
You always go with Andy.
Would you take him?
No, I'm fine, thanks.
It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
Hope I make it through both.
Honey, I gotta go.
And what else is bothering you?
I don't like what he does.
Get out of here!
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
Up.
Are you coming...?
Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
Here.
What's that?
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
Me, too.
What's up?
Okay.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Well, that's why you got it.
Yes, you can.
What do you mean, we don't?
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America"
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
Why?
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
I like it when they wake up.
That's because I am the shark.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
And big for his age.
Thanks.
You like Florida?
I'm a water-skier.
How come?
The one that goes underwater?
What're you doing later?
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Aww, can't I keep it?
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
No, South Georgia.
Reach for the limit I always say.
Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
That's Dad...
Who's grown up?
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
I don't want to.  I want to swing....
He was doing his job....
My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
We forgot to stop at the store.
It went away....
I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers....
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
He heard that.
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
What?
Dad died from a heart attack....
I'm fine....
I am.
You just got here....
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
I don't know how....
Where do I pull off...?
A big one....
A big one....
You're not going to bet it all....
I borrow it without telling him....
I do....
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
I know a guy who got money from them to study eels....
Stop busting my hump....
Down here....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
When we got the grant....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
The shark will get it for us.
So far..
Who?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
'A Moray eel....'
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
Mom....
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
Oh, Jake... 
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
I'll take care of it.
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
"Welcome to Eureka."
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
How'd you do it, old man?
I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
No, you didn't.
Then give me that Zippo.
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
Car accident.
Now?
This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
Bits.
What is all this Jennifer stuff?
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
Have you got a print from the hand?
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
He says, you freaked one of em out?  "Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous" ..
And did they?
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
Your predecessor. He did- n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T ..
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
No.
Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded "hollow" ..
Of course I would ..
Hamlet. Have you read it?
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers?  He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.
Ross told me.
Really? What did he say?
Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..
Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
You do?
It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
Ask him.
It's a plan --  -- _ 51.
Could you just stop moving?
I have to finish my job --
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
I see what you're saying.
Oh come on --
-- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --
Absolutely.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
Happy. He said "happy?"
Yeah, what happened there.
Oh good.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Right.  I'll come in.
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
Come on, Jerry.  You know this isn't easy for me.  _ 118.
Good.
Thanks.
Ten seconds, Rod.
I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
Uh, not today, but --
I understand your anxiety.
No, I air-dry.
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
No tell me. _ 84.
Good deal, man.
How do I know?
Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
You don't want to go home, do you?
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
That's an answer.
Damn right.
Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
Not a chance.
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
You said "fuck".
One way to find out.
It is truly, what’s the word? Inspiring.
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
He's this way.
We have to help him.
When did you have it last?
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
I didn't know, there were two islands.
They're here.
That does sound lucky.
They never got that big.
We should take it with us to signal any planes.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
Let me know if I can help, Alan. You’re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
Are you sure?
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
Stan.
Just a little bit too much, I think.
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
I don't even know this woman.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
The velociraptors.
You version of it.
Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
So that others would know about this place?
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
John Hammond.
Are you insane?!
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
How would we cut off the lysine?
No trick to it.  Just stop running the program.  Leaving them unattended.
Pretty sure.
A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
The Cretaceous.
- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
You can't hold it by yourself!
That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
What's that?
It's anti-nature.
Yeah.
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
Are they heavy?
Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
Tim, are you okay?
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
No.
Not without massive sequence gaps!
Why?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you two, uh - - are?  I wish you the best luck.
Yeah, they hate me.
Fine.
Relatively.
We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
Oh, I hate the other kind.
Yes.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
Thanks, Dad.
Ken, we've been through this...
No, no... listen, when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Get rid of them.
I know... but we left the main trail... and I can't find any landmarks around here... I've been trying to figure it out but...
Help me with this.
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
Who?
Video store?
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_.
Doesnit sleep?
He wets the bed?
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Insomnolesence...
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
Uh-huh...
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...
How's that possible?
Think it'll do any good?
And if he's not?
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
Yes -- that's us.
Did you?
The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man.  Very good.
In a manner of speaking.
Yes.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
And you're late!
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.
As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
Usually.
It's a farce.
That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time.
Orlac is an account?
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
Oskar.
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
Value? ... Value?
No!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
Native costume?
An ape ... some kind of ape.
Yeah.
Coz of something I lost.
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
Sure dear, yes.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --
Guess!
Didn't want you.
Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a -- position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book.
You said that.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
I can't say he was anybody!
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
Is that what you gave him?
No, I said what did you think.
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
Don't worry.
How?
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
What am I supposed to say?
Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
I was wondering what that was.
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
You could at least look at me!
What?
I believed her, Pete.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
Did she talk about him to you?
I think she's trying that.
Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life.  But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction.
Town Police.
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
What else do you know?
Trask --
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Do you like to be with your mommy?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Show.
On earth.
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
Uh huh...
Oh...
See you in the morning light.
Sure.
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
Uh, huh?
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Yes.  Very much.
Thank you.  I have no further questions.
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
My, we are a hot shot aren't we?
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Do you have a lover now?
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
I'm not taking him with me.
Yes...How's Billy?
What?
I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
Yes, what?
I don't believe you.
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Fine.
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
What?
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
A moment.
Again?
Where will you keep them?
I will not approve it.
Yes.
Far, far away.
Please.
Roughly five thousand men.
Is that big?
Look here!
Can India help us?
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
Good day.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
I leave tomorrow.
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
Is that true or pretend?
But, I have no experience.
Oh, but you do, Kundun. Who else would be here?
I see that.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
And you like me.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
This could end up saving your life,--
Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
Get the gun.
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
The more he thrashes, the better.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
Nothing's real.
Oh, bullshit.
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
I <u>told</u> you.
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
You wouldn't?
Well.  At wakes.
And this is how he came to the boat?
You talk to the married couple?
And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?
What the hell?
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
I asked you to be nice to him.
Absolutely.
It's ten after nine.
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
I'm not even a field person.
<u>Kelly</u>--
Shitbutt?
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
Starling -
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
They weren't there. Get close-ups.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Did you ever work with her?
Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job. This - toaster giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit. What did she know, big dummy...
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
I am, yes.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
It's much better than your shoes.
No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Ahhh... Why?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Mmm. And what else...?
Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it will be "turns" with us, too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things. Not about this case, though - about yourself. Yes or no?  Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock...
A cattle ranch?
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
No. We just -
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
So you ran away...
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
But you could. You did.
Promise...?  Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Did you breast-feed her?
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
Let's go with it.
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
Absolutely.
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
Our father? Did you see my father?
It can be dangerous...
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
What the bloody hell plan is this?
...Fort William Henry.
Dark haired...
No.
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
That's all, sir.
Atten-hut!
Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
Granted.
My colors?
We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
Why Sixpack?
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
Crunch...Implosion.
Can you fix it?
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
That's an order!
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
The escape bubbles?
Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
And it killed Bo?
I know that.
Timex...
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
Like a leech.
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
The air's stopped.
Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him.
Jesus, Tom, do they work?
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
I'll think of something, don't worry.
I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
I am not fucking interested.
Nope.
It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
Let's have a look, shall we?
Is that you, Dean?
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking Everest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a mon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first fucking idea who did this to us, do you?
No.
What the fuck is going on?
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Plank?
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
I will loan you the money.
And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?
Hold on. OK.  Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest.
Lives and learns doesn't one.
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
My van is half full.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?]
It's pathetic. You can't be desperately in love when you're 14 years old.
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun.
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
Catholic school, nasty.
Yes, sir--
I am, sir.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Because it's a job?
Thank you, sir.
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
You're testing me?
Nice job.
He swore by it.  What?
So is Buddy on your short list?
That's not the point.
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Come on in--
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
Go out through the back.
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
They fought against the Indians?
They were in the Army. Like your father.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
I have a B average.
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
It's a .45.
We been through this before--
We should just do it.
That ring--
Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
This is an official visit, then--
Me llama Eladio Cruz--Bienvenido a Tejas. [Welcome to Texas.]
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
I thought you were married!
Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish--
That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'--
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news--
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
I haven't been out here for a while.
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
Do you?
Buddy Deeds--
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
He was killed.
Right. When he was killed.
I never said that.
I never said that. It was just that boy--
You ever play one of these?
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
What about it?
You got in late last night.
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
Three months.
It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
Are you okay?
No--
You don't want to be Sheriff.
Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
How come it feels the same?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
Uh-huh.
Gotta be in person.
Oh.
Yeah.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
You sell much out here?
Name's Otis.
Otis what?
Payne.
Nix.
Nix?
I love weird.
Knew what?
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
Yes.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
I think we make our own futures.
Why not?
You haven't seen anything yet.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
Out!  Out!
No word from D'Amour?
What makes you so sure?
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
Mine.
Philip Swann?
Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
Yes.
Help me.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
I won't say anything.
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
For an introduction.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
I did it for Dorothea.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
Didn't know you read minds.
Is that all?
A couple of weeks.
You don't think I've got it to give?
No!
Liar!
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
Bob, it's me.
I'm thinking about it.
Oh, what do you do with that?
I know, it's stupid.
No, its easy.
I don't know.
Yeah, you don't remember?
No, I was looking at you.
Yeah? But look at you.
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
But, I'm mean.
We established that we have no communication.
Oh, she'll love it.
Working.
That sounds great — can you hold on...  What Zoe?
Ok, well... I love you.
You know, eat healthier.
Ok.
Bye.
Evelyn Waugh was a man.
Good...I'm tired.
What?
Bye.
Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...
Ok, I will... later.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Sure.
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
Promoting that action movie I did...
It's amazing  there!
Do you think they have a room here?
Hmmm.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
I can't believe Will killed him.
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care.  And then, minutes after they left, he suffered a stroke. He's comatose.  No brain wave activity at all.
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
You heard voices, you know you did.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
You raised me, like a son.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again...
Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Well I know he's come here before.
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
Trick him.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
Terrific.
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
The police used him as a witness in this case.
You watch.  One day, I'll hit the jackpot, get the big house, car, clothes.  I'll have more money than God.
It's Detective Smythe.
Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
Need any help?
Engaged.
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
No I don't.
I don't remember that.
What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
Okay?
This time get your feet set.
Shh.  It's okay.
It's okay.
Yes, we appreciate that.
I don't know sometimes.
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
No one's forcing her.
I told him you looked like me.
I know.  But chances are...
So how's the job going?
I'll take that as a compliment.
Thanks, Sidra.
Didn't have to try very hard.
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
I just can.
Kay.
And?
God, here we go.
I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
What are we playing for?
My court, I go first.
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
You're not stupid.
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
Hey, what's up.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
No.
Getting there.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
So why'd you give up ball?
What?
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
Better late than never, right?
What?
So you're gonna bitch up?
What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
Business folks.
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
I have.
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
Yeah.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Later when?
I'm fine.
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
Why?
And some things should never fucking happen!
I don't know.
ooohhhhhh no.
-- no,no,no what is this? who? What's this guy's name?
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
Well can you connect me to someone else?
What kind of Cancer?
Brain and Lung.
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
No.  No.
Yeah.
You don't have a boyfriend?
No.
Who was it?
Yeah.
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
It's not -- what's a 422?
But I wouldn't mind comin' back in an hour just to see your pretty face!
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
If you're not here for a 422 --
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
Good bye.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
Well...is that illegal?
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
You wanna make a deal with me?
...yeah...
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Yes.
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
-- what kind?
Just hold it, you'll be fine.
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
-- Richard.
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
No.
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
This sounds threatening.
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
I have love.
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
My name is Donnie Smith and I have lot's of love to give.
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
Solomon, please.  Please.  I am so fucked here if you do this.  This is the worst timing. The worst timing I could ever imagine. I need to keep working.  I have so many debts, so many things, I have, I have, I have -- I have surgery -- I have my oral surgery coming --
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
No.
When was the last time you talked to your son?
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
the valley?
And your father?
In five years?
What name?  My name?
"Frank" was my mother's father.
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
These Dogs'll calm down -- you just have to come in --
He's...I'm sorry...so sorry...I've seen this before, you know and you don't.... He's going very fast....Frank...um....
Uh. huh.
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
No.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
Fuck no.
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
I'm sorry, Stanley.
Did you tell her?
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
It's not really pain.
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
Was there anyone that I know?
How long with Paula?
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
Do you know the answer to this?
Did you ever touch her?
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
It's alright.
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
Movie Of The Week.  I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --
No they don't --
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
Tell him I'm sorry, ok, yes, you do that, now, I'm sorry, tell him, for all the things I've done...I fucked up and I'm sorry.... And I'm Gonna Turn Away And Walk Now And Not Look At Him Not See My Man, My Earl, I'll leave now...and tell him it's ok and I'm ok. The whole thing was ok with me -- and I know.
mmmhmm.
818-753-0088.
Mmm.Hmmm.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
Do you have that?
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
Hi.
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more.  But that one, it was enough.  Enough to make me love you forever.  I want you to remember that... and go on.  As strong as you are now.  No matter what happens.
He is your brother!
A body.
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
About to hang himself, I should think.
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
So what has changed?
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
There are more important things than tits.
So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
Come on...
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
To kill the king.
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
Just... water.
Phillippe.  Rest now.
Your Majesty has had many women --
At least help Raoul.
It shall be done, your Majesty.
Get out of my way.
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
... The ball... Continue.
What number, on the first page?
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
Sire, I --
You would do that, your Majesty?
Yeah?
Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
Every step of the way.
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
Great. Well that changes a lot...
Don't worry -
I didn't hit shit!
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
Gotta come from somewhere...
Where do you come from, Marvosa?
Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
Well read this -
No...
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
What exactly did you see?
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
Please...
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
OK...where do you want to start?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.
Where is he?
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
That was Peterson upstairs.
It was you who did the asking.
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
What's the bottom line?
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
Where?
'You're very beautiful.
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
...I'm going to see Lecktor.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
In the kitchen.
I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Please, no.
'No' what?
Yes.
Yeah. It's right here.
No.
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
Hi, Linda. ..
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
To do what?
Blue, then.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
I love you...
I remember.
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
Is Crawford going with you?
William: you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed.
Will? Are you okay?
I want to see you, too.
Will?  You could come up here.
Yes. Is Molly there?
What's that?
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Go on to the house.
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
Are you gonna kill him?
...yes.
And?
Yes, I thought so.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
No.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
I refuse.
LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
Really?
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
I don't wanna talk about it!
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
I can shtop whenever I want...
Andy... there is no real you.
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
Okay.  You're probably right.
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
And you're just poor white trash!
And you're just poor white trash!
They're asking for it.
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
It's working for Elvis.
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
They're gonna lynch him!
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
It's Choi.
If you get caught using that --
I intend to, believe me.  Someone has to.
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
The Matrix isn't real!
He's going to pop!
Sorry.
Midnight watch.
No.
Do you want to know what it is?
That you are a slave, Neo.  Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind.
What does that mean?
You've never used them before.
You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
Wild, isn't it?
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  I say almost funny.
And she knows what?  Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
Why?
That's why we're here.
Yes I do.
Shit, I'm sorry.
How did you know...?
I'm not the One.
Your next life, maybe.  Who knows. That's how these things go.
Who is?
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
From you.
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
What did she tell you?
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
It wasn't fast enough.
I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
No.
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
Tank, it's me.
Dozer?
What the hell just happened?
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
'And with your spirit.'
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
Nervous?
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
And say what?
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
Teresa.
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
That's the word...preoccupied.
You're intolerable today.
But...
We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.
Friends of yours Michael.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Sure.
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
He's coming.
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
But it's your birthday.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
We've got some things to discuss.
That's okay, Daddy.
But what?
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
Hot or cold.
"Death and Taxes"?
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
Of whom?
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
Did you just hear something?
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
Glad I could be of some help.
I thought this was practically a done deal --
I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
He said that?
Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
Doctor lady make it irey.
Mine, too.
No.  Nothing.
Good morning, Jennifer.
Yes?
Are you?
You're welcome.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
I haven't.
I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.
Then why are you here, Joe?
It comforts you, doesn't it?
Yes.  I'm tired.
Why don't you get off his case?
Why, yes.  Thank you.
Faster.  And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
For how long?
But there's so much to tell you --
I love you now, I'll love you always --
It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
Not at all.
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
Yes, Bill.
Yes.
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
Why didn't you stop me?
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
Just a manner of speaking.
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
Not at all.
You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it.  And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death.
I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
He is --
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
Yes.
Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
Speak up, please.
No, you're not.  You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
Drew told me.
Don't get dirty, Dad --
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
Bravo.
Aw, you're tough.
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
Will it?...
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
Then what will you say?
It's something.
Joe?
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
Yes, but --
Daddy --
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
You never know.  Lightning could strike.
Why not?
Because I like you so much.  Now I've got to go.
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
From what?
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
Take the money and walk away!
You told me.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
Why?
Sorry.
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
What?
Course not.
What happened?
Who?
What does he want?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
I don't remember. See, I have no short-			* term memory. It's not amnesia -				   *
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
I don't remember.
Mr Gammell?
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
That, and your thing.						   *
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
Are you sure?
But he's not the right guy!					  *
A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
Lemon or lime?
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
Where's the new drop point...?
Of course.  From my side, I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it...  So let me know if we're on...
Make it 35.
Really?  So, what is this, a party?
What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Where's that?
The Keys?
To mothers.  And all that we owe them...
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Is it December?
Twenty-eight-point-five.
Maybe I'm only one.
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
Really?
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.
Is this the protective male talk?
What'd Neptune tell you?
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
Something's wrong.
Port-Au-Prince.
Where?
We're makin' moves on each other.
If you're down, we're down for the play.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
That's right.
Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
On the phone.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
You're hoping to get a look at what?
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
Yeah?
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Okay. Never argue with a man.
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
I don't know. Cops. Or the -- how should I know?
I read it.
It's so exciting. New York. The mad forward thrust of everything. My sense of time here is completely altered.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Ready for anything.
Instant V-goddam-D.
History, man, history. How much?
Two kilos.
How's your hernia?
Nah, just covered with batshit!
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
The catacoombs?  Whaddya want, a door?  There's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in Istanbul.
Billy?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
How far?
Sixty Lira?
Not far. Just a little way.
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Would you recognize him again?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
...She was on the plane.
Thank you.
What do you mean?
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
I don' t know. It's someplace down in there....  ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
What?
Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up.
What is it? . . . Billy?
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
Did you ask for bail?
The lawyer?
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
Shit.
Take a look.
Right.
The kid's with them!!
You don't do that, we're on the wrong track.  You...
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
Across both tracks!!
Please.
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
Maybe they lied to you.
I heard how you talked to him.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
That's camouflage...
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
Sure.
Following me?
Lucky for you, I did.  Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels...
If you wouldn't mind.
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
It's fine.
The phones are working?
I can live with "great."
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
Misery?
I'm...
I DIDN'T...
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
Great.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
I'm telling you, I can't.
Have to wait.
Oh...
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
I'm glad you like it.
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
Oh, I like that tone.
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
That'd be a first.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
I suppose I did.
A change of plans?
Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
In downtown Sydney for a start.
Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
- or hard wired, right.  First line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. Basically impenetrable, I'd say.
I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
No.  Should I?
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
- right..
Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
So do I.  Sort of.
I'd like a little more conviction..
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
What did you think of him?
Not necessarily.
The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
..not in time to save him.
I'm fine..
Yep.
All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
Do I?
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
S.O.P..
Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
Fold it.  Fold it tight.
Krieger.
Oh yeah?
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
Go secure.
Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
No sir.
Yeah.  I follow you.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
Now I want you to hold onto it.
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
On what?
Why should I?
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
In Langley.
We'll see.
Just waiting for you, tubs.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
No, weíre going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!
He won't be back in a hurry?
Sure.  If the main character does.
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
Yeah.
Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
What's going on?
Itís not working.
Run it through from the top.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
And that's how much I'm saying.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
Let's go tell your Mother.
What'd you do to your hair?
I brought you something.
They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
I'm going to marry him.
I have no life.
How many men since then?
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
I was dead.
What?
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
Hi.
I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
You're making me feel guilty again.
I know what I know.
Yeah.
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
Right.
On the floor?
Alright.
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
Then let's set the date.
You have a brother?
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away.
We should talk alone.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Pop.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
Your hair's different.
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
Did you see it?
No.
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
You should think about this.
Alright.
I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
No idea.
It was a miracle!
And you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
Definitely!
She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
What do you do?
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
Yes.
Yes.
No.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
Is who down there?
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
Bring her forward.
So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
Through ... We found them.
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
What is that?
What?
Come on then.
Had enough?
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
Look!
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
My liege,  I am honored.
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
No.  No.  No!
What does it say?
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
You got us all worked up.
Charge!
What?
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Shut up!
Yes, Lord.
Good idea, O Lord!
My name is Sir Launcelot.
To seek the Grail!
Yes he is.
Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
Well ... I'll tell you ...
No ... just keep him in here.
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
You are in great peril.
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
Don't say that word.
Look.  I'm warning you.
Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
How about yourself?
Sixty.
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
Mary Taylor, sir.
Are you all right, Barney?
A situation?
Convey her a message.
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
I don't think about it.
I'm fine.
Was there never ambition?
The greasy pole.
No love.
In time, she will.
Yes, ma'am.
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
Yes.
Of course I shall say what I have to say.  I always do.
I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
Well, both.
Mrs Brown.
No, she wasn't.
Dear oh dear.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
We were expecting you to return by six.
I have no idea.
Why not?
Ma'am.
You can't.  He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get progressively less time to complete.  First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.  If you don't...
Security camera.  Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live.
Sure.
My house.  I want to try something.
Like the fractals?
...but then it hits the relay stations...
No I'm not...
You didn't hear me?
Yes I am...
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
I don't want to talk about it.
Never been on a snowboard.
Yes...
Oh God...oh god...
Not yet, honey...
So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?
No.
It's been a very strange day.
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Okay.
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
You got it! See you later honey.
Sweetie, look at me straight.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
Right. See ya.
Good luck, honey!
Yes, there was.
Diane?
But it said #12.
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
"But you won't..."
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
I'm all right.
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
Yeah, what for?
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
This Denny's.
Okay. Why this Denny's?
Right then.
Could be unrelated.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
The one of 'em still alive?
Sure.
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
I'm not fucking him..
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
Excuse me ?
Is this really the time ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
That was eleven years ago.
What the fuck are you talking about.
Where ?
Yes, sir Mom. 
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
You did.
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Fire the whole division.
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
I don't know.....
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
I'll see that bet.
Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
You're paying the bills.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office ?  I am sorry. Perhaps we should have dinner tonight to.... discuss your future.
Are you writing a poem?
I don't even know your name.
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
Well you know what I mean.
I figured you did.
What boy likes you?
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
Maggie...Maggie's little girl.
Special effects?
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
You're so clever.
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
What, you think the guy should change his name?
He is one of the great poets.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
In the tar??
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
Really?
And you'd be my cousin?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
Yeah?
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
For the mini-bike fund.
Phil, I think you should consider... fades as Vada walks off
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna stay.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Something wrong?
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
But Dad'll never go for it.
Good for you baby.
No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
WHAT?
Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,  Gimme the goddam keys.
The boss is watching us...
I'm impressed.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
They're dead?
Deceased.
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
It's no big deal.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
What's that?
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Are you mad at me?
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
This is where we are.
Really?
Hand me the canula.
Any more soda left?
Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Soon honey, soon.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
Why not?
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
What do you get for that?
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
Oh, Vada...
Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.
Yes it is.
My ball, I lost my ball.
Mostly love, and romance.
Aarrggh.
Where's Daddy?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I'm eleven and a half.
I'm allergic to it.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
If I do it, can we go?
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
What do you think it's like?
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
I am not.
Hurry!!!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Really?
They're getting married?
I don't like her.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
Leave then, some friend you are.
Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
Kindred spirits.
Desperate.  To talk.
You're butting in.
And you believe that.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
The man you love.
I wish.
I can't even say it.
It's too late to start over.
And what will he do?
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
I was gonna predict that.
He has you on a pedestal.  And me in his arms.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
Nobody has.  So far.
My very point.  Here's another one...
Waiter! Check, please!
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
Like I said, dazzling.
If you like.
The night we met.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
That's my point!!
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
... yeah, that.
I came here, looking for her.
That is so romantic.
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
No.
You have to what?
Green.
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
Okay. Thanks.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
They can come to the concert in the park.
Whose?
Stop it!
How come?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Hi, Sherry.
How'd you get in here.
No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
I'm not really a musician.
No.
Do you carry door handles?
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Who is this?
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
What?
Oh.
Oh?
I can't.
Car pool?
I'm sorry but I have to go.
Mary?
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
Oh --
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
Where are you from?
I know a couple.
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
You think I got any kind of a voice?
You think it will?
May I see your costume?
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.  So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.
Yeah.
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Who is we?
Susanville, Soledade.
By all means.
Not good.
It's video.
She doesn't talk?
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
No.
On average forty million.
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
Where do the air ducts lead?
It's hard to say Capt'n.
Take a wild stab!
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
When do you want the assembly?
Tomorrow.
Why?
How so?
By all means.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
Lose 'em.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Yeah.
See Duff. He's the money man.
You think so, Frankie?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Okay.
Then do like I said.  Men - this boy here's got something to tell you-all.  Well, how about it?
Walker and Williams.
Okay.
Name's Duff.
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Okay.
You know, over at the mill, there's just one guy that talked. It's kinda late to say it, but we shoulda acted different.
Oh yeah? That's good.
Okay, I will.
You working?
In Birmingham.
Your folks live there?
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
You got a problem all right.
Take it easy.
You almost got into trouble back there.
What d'you mean?
Just for the day?
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
Four.
Okay, I guess.
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Well, if you don't know I can't tell you.
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
How come you keep askin'?
You will.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
What 'you signifyin'?
I'm Duff.
They'll run you out.
All right, son.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
That'll make the folks very happy.
Okay, boy, beat it.
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Negotiator entering Kill Zone.
Then we would have talked, you and I.
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
How's the villa's security?
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
No, but it traced me.
Linked?
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
Can you walk?
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
Can you take me to it?
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
You can make your move when it comes after me.
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
How much time you got left?
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
No!... No...
Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
Where did you here that?
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
What's my end?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
What the fuck... are you serious?
On a good run... yeah.
Yeah.
Give me five minutes.
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Who?
NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
If you say so.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.

We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
Have you been to any parties?
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
He's my teacher!
Cool. I'll catch you later.
I'm Rob's prom date.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
Really?
Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words--  in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon"? How for her it was like a Concord grape. "That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--"
You remember that story?
Why do you do that?
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Lock.
Can't you make other creations?
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
Just out for a while.
Oh, come on Dad...
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
Get outa here.
I'm sorry...
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
Who?
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
yeah, I had a bad night.
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
Who?  Who's doing this to you?
Hi, Kerry.
Yor dad picking the music again?
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
Mom?
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
Watching TV.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
Wait and see.
Jennifer --
He's too strong!  He was never this strong!
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm serious.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
With Hypnocyl?
Who would know where they were hidden?
Hey, everybody has bad dreams.
The by-product of guilt.  Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
They used to keep a spare key.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
My God.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Oh, stop showing off.
Fifteen million dollars.
Fine.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Oh right.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Hello.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Absolutely fine about it.
And what happens next in the dream?
Exactly.  Here we go again.
No, you were brilliant
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
This is the place.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
Right.
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
You disappeared.
Well... how have you been?
What's the thing?
Tempting but... no, thank you.
Is that right?
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Does the girl have a name?
Of course.  And is he your favourite Italian film director?
You daft prick!
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
... can't let you through.
So -- any messages?
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Right.
What?
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Y-y-y-yes...
I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Mister McMurphy!
Will you come with me, please.
Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
I wanna report a robbery!
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
No way.
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
Thank you, ma'am...
Thank you, ma'am.
Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
Yeah, kid?
Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that fella.
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Yeah...
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
Lend me twenty.
Shhh...
Like hell we will! We got the muscle standing right here. All we need is a couple gaffin' hooks and some rope.
She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
Just warmin' up.
So why are you talking to him?
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I said out!
I just started!
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
When?
Gary Blinker...
What's this?
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
Me too! Me too!
He's not!
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Oh, what was that?
Poker!
I see.
I see...
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
You bet, Doc!
I'm afraid not.
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
Shhh!
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
I don't believe it...
Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
'Kay...
Ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on my knees.
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
Oh, yeah...
Are you a doctor?
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
How 'bout twenty?
Bet!
Evenin', ma'am.
Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies. These are nice guys. Nice guys.
Is he in an asylum?
Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin' a risk of gettin' my black ass fired. If you understand what I mean...
Oh, I'm all through talkin'. Now, let's just you an' me trip on down that hall.
Your mother.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
Why?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Let's find a telephone.
Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.
What's mezzaluna?
Okaaaaayyyy.
Please, Larry.  I have to hurry.
Thanks.
Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
So?
Right now?
Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
I would call it-- unforgivable.
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
I brought you that, too.
Sure is.
You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
Oh.
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
I have vacation time coming to me.
You don't have a passport.
He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying. 
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
We lost him?...
Oh.  Right.
Nothing.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
I never even got to be single.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up.
I know, but...
You sure you'll be okay?
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
Uh huh.
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
Larry, did you rent a car?
A porco?
Oh.
What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
I thank you.
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
And we didn't have to bring another present?
She's not here.
No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??
Whatever.  And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  And He did. She told me the name.  Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too. Ask any rummy  on the dock if I'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me.  But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin' watchman's pension. When I was sixteen I had to beg for work in the hold. I didn't work my way up out of there for nuthin'.
He was always a good kid. You know that.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
Maybe.
I wish I didn't have to do this, Terry.
I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
Tommy, what happened?
I'll get home all right now.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
I want to be a teacher.
In braids? That's right.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
How would you've done it?
With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
What for?
Hit me again, Mac.
Terry!
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
What for?
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
I don't rate it.
Go ahead, wear it.
I know... I know... .
I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do..I don't know what to do... .
Edie...
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Thanks just the same.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
Are you on the level, Father?
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
I think you could have.
Really?
Yeah, really!
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Raise a hand to me and... .
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
No?
Easy. Easy, boy.
Hey look-
I'll see you on the roof.
Forty-five bills.
Gimme.
By way of Chicago?
Listen, Johnny—
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
I wonder how many Hail Marys the Father'll make me say at confession.  It'll be worth it! The pallet is loaded now. Terry turns and approaches Nolan.
Nolan... .
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
You do?
Yes I feel it in my bones.
You're talking nonsense.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
Tie them that they may watch.
It would seem so, Master
There are others.
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
Then cancel my order.
Oh, if there is only time!
For what!?!
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
I'm so frightened.
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first.
No, thanks.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
Maybe this'll make you feel better.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
Now you're talkin'.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
Or two.
Just hung up.
What about that D.B. Cooper guy?
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
Whatta you wanna do?
I don't ski.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
All you gotta do is get in.
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
Daniel.  Listen --
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
Call and tell you.
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Why you think is today?
You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice.  But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five.  Saving yourself for the main event.  Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
I bet.  How much?
Low class of people there, Snoop.
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
So you've done this before, huh?
Why, are you famous?
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
Yeah...
None of your business.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
You won't do that.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Or once.
He killed a police officer.
You believe that?
Why are you mad?
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
I'll take the shades off.  Just get this fuckin' thing off me.
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
Must be a real soft pillow.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
It's a big house.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
What's to think about?
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
Jesus, I don't believe it.
Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
You're not?
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
What's going on, Glenn?
And is Foley a part of this?
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there.
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
How you know that?
You're not my type.
He said he stayed here last November.
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
No thanks.
No, he looks a lot...
You wave back?
I imagine you would've though.
So?
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
No.  Course not.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm talking about how you make them show!
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Kill the bastards!
Good shooting, Rafe!
How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
Little less.
Yeah.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
Thank you, Sir.
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
I know.
Nice to meet you, Betty.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
Have the planes made it to China?
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
Learn English, then!
Fook ya dooble!
So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
I'm not going.
I call this the staccato. 
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
I just can't trust you anymore.
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
Just take a look at it. 
You're going to listen to me.
What?
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
I'm trying.
Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
I beg your pardon?
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
I'd love to.
I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
The house payments.
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it.
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
I	know what a burrito is.
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
When do we start?
Come on. You can't be serious.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
Exactly! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...
Well... uh... thanks...
Pretty much so.
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
Sure.
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
Bob...
Allright. Calm down.
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
I'm not going to die.
Ready for what, baby?
We're waiting...
Uh, yeah.
Congratulations.
Little baby girl.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Makeup.
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
You're right.
What?
No. I didn't.
Catch me later, I'll be here. And tell Amy, I love her painting, it's on my wall.
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
One. Here, in front of my ear.
No. I can't really see it.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
Where's Dad?
Yes.
Thank you. No more questions.
Right.
I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
Since when?
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
Charles...
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
Riddick? How close?
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
Let's just be sure.
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
That's what I said.
I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
What the hell's it matter?
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
Frightening thought.
We're all on the same hajj now.
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
Well, what's it look like now?
Just realized that, huh?
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
You still don't believe me, do you?
Neither do I.
It's probably wrong --
You didn't think so then.
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
Any particular reason?
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...
Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
Yes, I can do that.
I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
I think you're making a mistake.
The Hunt Club.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
Then you admit --
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
Second from the left.
Like you, I find it difficult.
Where?
I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor  NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me Junior.
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
They're scared? What about me! I'm sick of this shit man, I'm sick of this shit! They don't want us here! Who do you think they're fighting for! GET OUTTA THERE!
Jes' fine man, jes fine! Ain't never felt better! Both of us two timers man, we're out.  See you at the hospital man, we gonna get high-high yessir... 
Yeah.
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
What you got there - beers?
I volunteered.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
If I change my mind.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
I see.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
Whatever you say.
Much too late.
He got in here how?
Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything.
I don't.
Nice of him.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
That's putting it mildly.
I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it.
Then he's got to be a detective.
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
You're probably mistaken about that.  Let's get together sand talk it over.  There's always a solution to these problems.  But it must be near the water.  Quite near--  Yes, if you don't mind waiting.
They're going to arrest me.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
I was tried for murdering my husband.  Guilty.  The judge set the verdict aside.  There was one man on the jury--  --but he was afraid.  They were all afraid--of my father-in-law. That man followed me last night-- he came from him of course.  My father-in-law will never give up. Never.  He promised me that.  So I came to Vancouver, B.C. As far away as I can get from North Carolina.  And it happens all over again.  Almost the same thing. Almost the same way.  Do you wonder about this--
Killaine...
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I have to kill both of us--
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
If I did-I don't-now.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
That's an evasion and you know it.
Who told you I was married?
Yes.
They call me Jeff.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
Who's Goble?
This way.
I'm not interested in blind dates.
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
Fascinated.
That comedian?
Round of golf Saturday?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
That's what I thought, at first.  Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party.  With my liquor of course.
I have a warrant for her arrest.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
What do you want?
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
What do I get for it?
Sounds like a fair swap.  Let's take a look.
I've met her.
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
I am a fool.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
The card says so, doesn't it?
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
Nice.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
You don't have to make a pose of it.
What does it look like?
I told you she's just..
Be nasty.
It's fine, thank you.
Yes.
Penfield.  James Penfield.
Very good.
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
A glamorous young lady way above his station...
Are you going to have coffee?
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
And to history.
How nice.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
Both dead.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
Ah, ah.  There's more.  The piece celebrates the undying affection between eminent left-wing historian and he dazzling daughter.  Then the news editor, who happened to be in the room, said that years ago, when he worked on The Guardian, Anne Barrington had written a very good piece on...guess...Suez.  It was 1966, the tenth anniversary.
She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
Far too long.
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
Will it be fun?
Are you up to something?
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
Oh, I see.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
What about the Cromwells?
I'm not here.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
What would you call it?
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
Promise.
De nada.
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
You gotta earn trust.
Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
You first!
Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
You gotta tell me where she is.
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Babes.
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be?
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.
Figured you did.
Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
Who cares!
I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
Like the old days, Dillon.
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
They're getting better equipped every day.
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
What, Sergeant?
Mmmnnn...?
Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
Hope to be?
I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
How?
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
You're not from L.A., huh?
Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
Edward... you got it!
Diet coke.
Why?
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
No?  Why's that?
Where'd you learn to do this?
Done.
I got a dress, yeah.
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
I have work to do.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
Ready to stomp sod?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Stuckey!  He wants an "appointment" with me after you leave.  You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
You just did.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
Right.
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry.
But, Edward...
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
Goodbye, Bill.
Why?
Yes.
I bet.  That was our rent!
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
You bullshittin' me?
Oooh, I love those.
You're a guest here?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
And who is that?
Miss Vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
I think you'll find it normal enough.
But I always eat like this.
What if they serve soup?
You're not accompanying him to New York?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Till they kill you. Yeah.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
Of course you will.
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
There will never be a need.
It never happened.
You never said anything about killing anyone.
He's really very short on charm.
Yeah?
Have you any money?
Has it been fifteen minutes?
I'll be right back.
Has it got any sports in it?
Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
As you wish...
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters --  -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.
I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
Of course.
Hah?
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
Tell me.
No one of consequence.
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
You've made your decision then7
Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
Nobody's hearing nothing!
An hour.
Think it'll work?
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
"To my honey I'll croon,
"Keep a shining in...
Oooooooops!
Ooooooops.
Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
Well, sir, it seems ...
It's nothing ... nothing.
Mr. Bialystock ...
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
What was I saying?
What do you mean?
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
But what if the play was a hit?
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Maybe you're happy.
Okay, take it off, take it off.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Do you think he'll take the job?
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
Of Siegfried...
The Blue Max...
Good.  Good.  Now ve sign the contract.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
Send for Goebbels.
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
Or arrived with her.
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
She isn't still here, is she?
Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like.  Come on.
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
Money.
Sam, if she's here...
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
Forty thousand dollars.
Like what?
What difference does that...
What's the matter?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
What do you know about it?
Huh?
No.
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
Where's the old highway?
Just wait here?
Sam.
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
Yes.
You're not.
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
I believe it.
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
Los Angeles.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
A man should have a hobby.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Is anything wrong?
Maybe you saw Mary!
Arbogast.  And after he left?  No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been going out there?  Well, I think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you know... but...
Have you two had breakfast?
We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.
Haven't any.
Fine.
And now that your mother's dead?
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
From what?
Did I?
Then you knew of the inheritance?
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
How? What can I do?
Go to sleep!
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
Well, I do say it.
I'm not quarreling, only ...
What do you think I am?
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
How's every little thing?
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
That's the one.
Hotcha! Saved, one job!
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
Oh, is that what caused it?
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
Not at all -- let me show you how easily it can be done. 
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
But I have some friends waiting.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
They were just bad men, that's all.
What is it, Rose?
What'd you do, Rose?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
Well, nothin'.
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Take a little walk with me, huh?
Five hundred rabbits?
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
I do, too!
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Well, a little.
Daddy, what's the matter?
Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.
Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
Here comes Daddy.
Is her husband sick or something?
No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
I'm not blubbering.
Of course.
What?
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
I don't intend to mock you, dear. I respect your philosophy. It's beyond my comprehension, but I respect it.
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Better off? How could she ever find love and happiness, if you did what you're talking about? Are you insane?
You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died.
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Do you know what a friend you have got there? Do you know she would fight for you like a tiger, that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you? Is this any way to repay her trust and love? Are you ashamed as I am ashamed?  Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But let me warn you, damn your hide, this is Thermopylae and I am standing here. Do you hear me, damn you. I am standing at Thermopylae and the Persians shall not pass! Now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes, and stop crying!
Got yourself up?
There are more on the other side.
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
Yes, sir.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
No, you're not.
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York. But the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse.
She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Well, you run on now.
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address.
I don't mind.
And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right!
Incestuous.
Am I supposed to take this information and sit up in the hills with a frickin' telescope?
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
Dean Martin.
Speak for yourself.
General Jim Beam, then.
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
Can't I?
We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
Murderer?  Really?
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
Absolutely.
Don't crowd him.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
Out here.  On your knees.
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
Maybe it's enough.
There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
Do tell.
It's one of a kind.
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
Jabba's palace.
Fine. Together again, huh?
Wouldn't miss it.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
Yeah, sure.
I gotta get you out of here.
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
I don't know.
Ahhh...
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
Come on! Come on!
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Your Royal Highness.
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
Tell me.
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
So, you have accepted the truth.
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Disintegrated?
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
Yes.
Uh huh.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
From Transexual Transylvania.
So come up to the Lab.
That ain't no crime
Oh.
...Fine.
...I suppose.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
I sold them to you.
Do you have a phone?
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
It's only temporary.
It's okay.
What?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
'Bout seven.
Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
...What?
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
C'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed. If I go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood...
I can't go out.
Paulie!
It's not your house --
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
Owe you what?
You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
You's the novelty, Champ!
No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
One more round.
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
...Of the truck that run over your face.
No wine.
Why?
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
I'm sure you are.
I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
Did you hear what I said?
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
I won't.
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Yeah.
Yeah --
Rice is a bum.
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
Freak luck for sure.
How 'bout a glass of water?
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
Check the eyes, Ben.
Would you keep goin'?
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
I'm thirty myself.
...Sure.
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
I'll do okay.
...No.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
What?
C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
Check the scrawl.
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
Sounds like singin'.
I'll bet.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Ask her...
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
Wait here...
I don't work in Toontown.
Maybe.  Why?
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
No, it's not.
Yeah?
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
Only time will tell.
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
By my head here come the Capulets.
By my heel, I care not.
Is the day so young?
In love?
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
[Within] Juliet!
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Well what shall I swear by?
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
By the hour of nine.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Meaning, to court'sy.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Right.
A Plague o' both your houses.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
As my American friend Larry would say: are you fucking deaf?  It's under your seat.
Leaving...
I'm up for that...
The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
I thought I did.
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
Sent it where?
If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
I didn't expect that he would.
Created?
Gets the job done.
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
I can do that.
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
Well I ain't a cop.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
I'm going with you.
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
Because I owe you.  Look at that...
I don't know...
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
No, I don't.
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
I guess that's for the best.
Seamus Reilly.
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
The Russian would be easier.
It's a matter of respect.  Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Cash and what?
Oh, you would have done great.
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
It's the right thing to do.
Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
He would have done it to us, right?
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
You killed him...
Then we're screwed.
No we're not.
He killed her...he killed her...
It's NOT too late!
Yes it is.  I'm calling it in.  Right now.
Why don't you get to the point.
What's your offer, Jesse?
I'm not gonna take --  I'm not gonna take it in stride.  I had a good run turn to shit on me like that -  cleaned me out.
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
Shut up, Jesse.
Because someone may have gotten away.
No.  But he would, probably.
Nothing.
That son of a bitch.
How the hell did he find it?
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
What did he buy?
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
A week ago, at most.
I have a better plan.
Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Why would someone do that?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Uh...C?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Dammit you’re persistent.  I don’t want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
Why?
Dwayne -
I was on a roll!  I’m a little overextended now.
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
Well, same ol' same ol'.
Did they ever find out who they were?
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...
Well I don't know --
Give me the bad news.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
Not getting an answer?  For Christ's sake!  Call 911!  Let's get it locked down here!
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
I got my sources.
Is this about the funny money?
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
I don't think so...
You pick any girl for you and your friend.
She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet.
You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
I said that?  Which word was "goat?"
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
No.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
I'm calling for back up!
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
Ask me if I give a shit.
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
How do you know?
No.  It was my singing.
It's a bomb.
For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
Yes.  We have heaven.
What's a Chinese heaven?
I think we should stop talking.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
End of the line.
I did!
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
Fine with me.
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
The police can protect you.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did.
Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven on Earth."  You will find your answers there.
No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other?
Sir, I can explain.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
I know, but --
I got a call from the F.B.I.  The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.
A little.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
That silly-ass look on your face.
I was being polite.
It was not my intent --
You don't know what a shortcut is?
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
This concrete?  This is still America.
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
You know him?
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my Œhood.
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
The Feds?!
No...what?
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find Œem.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
He is the situation.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.
Shut up!
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
Good one!  Thanks.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
It's hurting.
"Never say die."
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
Yeah.
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Oh, please!
That must have made you proud.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
You have one?
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
Twice...
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
You can turn that finger around.
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
Five hundred.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
No.
Of course.
You know, there's no...
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
It's something I've always wanted to do.
I'm listening.
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
It's probably because you got him fired.
Lighten up, what?
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
Not this one.  This one's on me.
Good boy, Port Hole.
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
Even when you were young?
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
That doesn't make any sense.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
I told you.  Nothing --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
What was what?
Actually, he sounded nice.
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
What?
What?
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
So I mailed your letter.
Come on, Jonah --
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Howard.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
How amazing.
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
You'll find out.
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
Yeah.  What's that?
Your only hope.
Eighty dollars.
Do you want a fruit plate?
I don't know.  Do I?
What?!
P.  Dad?
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
What do you think?
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
It's a sign.
Okay.
I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
It might be in the kitchen.
Shut up.
Did too.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Get out.
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
No.
What about it?
Well, here's the number.  If you ever find yourself Sleepless, give us a call.  We also... do babysitting.
You could have called me --
No thanks.
Well, those new fellows you hired from out of town -- we brought 'em up here in a truck this morning, but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail.
You haven't tried locking them up!
No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
What has it got me, your union?
I'm a fool.
No.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
Like what?
But honey ...
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
Well, if that's possible ...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
Are you Australian?
What can I do for you?
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
That bad, huh?
I can't.
What happened to your eye?
And you admire that?
It gets me through the day.
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
I don't want to leave you.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
Twelve
Lead the way.
Why does it have to feel so bad?
I find myself in dire need of some cash.
Palmdale
Thanks for not laughing at me.
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
That was my idea.
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
Secret recipe.
Anything for a dear friend.
But I just met you.
Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
Yeah.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
I'll keep that in mind.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
When?
Question is, what are you doing here?
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
Bubba.
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
Whata you mean?  He told me -
Answer the fucking question!
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Why are you doing this?
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
Figured.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
You take account of the wind?
Hell, no.  I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.
They got squirrels there, too, right?
Of course, sir.
I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
It's worth it.
A half-track, anything.
No, three brothers of his were killed in action.  Command wants him out of there.
Pass.
The men said, nine.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
That's not what we're here for.
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
How about you take your position?
Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
Vecchio.
Bits and pieces.
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Sure, what do you want to know?
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass.
I don't like that one.
No, sir.
Get back to your positions!
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Yeah?
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
Pardon me?
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
No, no he's not.
We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
And your former wife.
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
See you tomorrow.
I am.
Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.
Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
Wait a minute.
I dream about it.
I'll put this past my boss
Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Dad.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Sit down.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
Just finishing up in here.
Swear to god.
Honey, about what?
Yes, I...
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Are you busy on Friday?
You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
Eight.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
Sure I do.
So what's your job this summer?
Then call me later.
I think you should wear that.
You think so?
Okay, bye, I will.
I'll see you there.  Bye.
I just can't have any social life right now.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
You need to study?
No, no.
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
No, I don't, I don't.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
Oh shit.
What?
Jim Court... no, this is her father.  I'll take...
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
Lloyd.
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
Sir, the list is correct.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
Breslau?  I can't go to Breslau.  Not now.
Good.
It's good business.
Yeah, sure.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
That's great.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
That's great, thanks.
God bless you, sir.
Nice things cost money.
Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
Yes.
Yes.
There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
I think it's too late.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
No?
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
I heard a noise.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
I did that.
What?
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Fair enough.
No, I don't.
Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
Until now.
And now, drum roll please...
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
Tails.
I never meant to imply...
I know that.
Can we turn the light on?
I'll give you one guess.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
No, wait...
What?
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
Thanks, Joel.
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
Closer than you think.
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
Melinda McGraw?
No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
Who is this?
Good bye Ben.
To see your reaction.
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
A note?
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
Absolutely.
How is that good news?
Catch him, or kill him.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Is that a threat?
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
No.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
Gale, your engine's still running.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
I am Gale Weathers!
That's funny.
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
I know!
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards.
My movie.
No.
W-what do you want?
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
No I need to call you. Just you.
Sorry.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
What?
I called my dad.
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
Who is this?
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
Who is this?
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
So you better leave.
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
Why are you doing this?
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
Don't do this. I can't...
Please..stop...
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
Yes, you doofus.
...yeah...
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
Yeah.
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
It'll be out later this year.
Many times.
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
Ricki Lake.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
What am I doing?
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Twice.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
What?
Like you had one.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Come on, let's rock.
Deal.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
Ease back, Mills.
It's always been like this.
What the hell's going on?
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
I realize that.
For now.
I read.  Remember reading?
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
How do you know all about this?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
We had him.
Then, he must write about these murders.
These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
When do we get to question him?
Well... what the fuck, man?
Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
Too long.  What do you think so far?
If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now... goodnight.
I'm sorry, I only...
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
I don't know.
How should I know?
Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time...I took mine to the Confederate States of America...  So did you, Reverend...
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
Sir?
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
Keep talking.
That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
You all settled an' comfortable now?
Ain't that too bad...If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours...
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
I got your boy killed.
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
Finish your breakfast...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
We got two around that age...
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Lady?
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
Wait!  Will you desist!
Twenty pounds on delivery
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
Treachery!
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
Ned is wrong for it.
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.
Who are you?
Fifty pounds? What for?
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!"
But your voice  Have they dropped?
"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
But the plague
Oh. What is your name?
Oh
Moonlight!
It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
That's my line!
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
Orsino…good name
I have spoken with your father.
The Queen has consented?
Wait there.
Let me see you. Take off your hat.
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
Serve.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
Have you seen him?
Juliet?
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
So who's going to do it?
Take his legs.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
I beg your pardon?
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.
I don't know anything about it.
But there's no --
Are you recording it?
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
Well, then?
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
Hugo.
His car's still there.
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
OK.
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
Who?
No, no, it's different.
You know we're right.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Alex.
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Burglary?
Of course.
Who said there were four?
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
With a face like this?
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
But they sneer, don't they?
Yes, sir.
What guy?
Here?.
I see.
And that's not the same thing?
That sounds fine.
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Chicken salad, Devra!
That kid... the hairdresser.
What?
What do you expect me to do about it?
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
I don't want to see you anymore.
I don't want to talk about it...
What about?
Why don't you see Lester?
Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
I know.
Are you in love with her?
No.
No shit.
Yeah.
You are.
Yeah.
Right, that's right.
Yeah.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Oh fuck, Norman!
I don't know. Probably not.
You going to tell him?
-- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
Yeah, I think so...
Sweetheart, you're drunk.
Jackie, can we --
Am I entertaining you?
-- mmm --
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
Oh yeah?
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
Yeah.
We live together now.
George?
Hello.
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
I already said hello.
Egypt.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
How?
Jesus.
Does it make you happy?
Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
What did you say?
Well, baby, I'm George and it needs to be cut.  But I don't want to place you in that position either.
In a way. But...
Thank you.
When?
Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
I know what you mean.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
What, do you think I planned it?
Why, why do you think that is?
Have a drink.
No --
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.

What was it, somebody's daughter?
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
George is going to open a shop.
Of course not.
Oh, I'm sorry.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Who is that?
A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
Don't be silly.
Well, what is it, honey?
Well, it's George.
-- He reached up and tore them.
What did you do?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
Two weeks from tomorrow.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
Yes, Dad.
Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Yes.
Room 237?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Okay.
Okay, Mom.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh!
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Thank you.
And, er... where are they now?
Grady... oh.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
Your money's no good here.
Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through.  I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.
Yeah.
Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
Good.
I just want to go back to my room.
Wendy give me the bat.
Stay... stay away!
I'm gonna go now.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Hi.
Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Jane-
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
What?
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
Do I need one?
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
Good.
Save this one for last.
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
I will- be good, kids.
Perhaps.
I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
LET THY SPIRIT
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
Oh-huh.
Oh my! 
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Yes, Betty?
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Am I?
That man -- who is he?
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline.  Hard work.
I... I...
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
It's true!
Enough joking.
Very well.
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
The reason?
And all those like you.
Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
You have a phone call.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
Saving you.  Move!
Oh?
I'm a Christian.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
Pray. 
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
I think they'd understand.
Really.
We're the guys from Vegas.  You had Christy last night, but you let her get away.  It's upsetting.
I'm telling you!
Maybe pants.
No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
However, we can also pray for other things.
It's better than springtime.
Christy.
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
Your superiors are two days away!
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
Pardon me?
There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
Believe?
But, sir... what books?  Where are they?
I know.  Hold on.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
What has happened?
What?
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
I apologize if I worried you.
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
And, what did he say?
What did he say, Katrina?
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo.  Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
You got any money?
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
How are you, Bill?
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
About a half a mile I think it is.
See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low.
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.
What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.
I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.
You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
How come?
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
All right then.
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
Who did you kill?
I thought they was.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
All right then.
He ain't no count.
I don't reckon I know.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
So it died when it come out?
You threw it in a trash barrel?
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
You will? For sure?
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
Yes sir.
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
Huh?
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
Right now?
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
I could shore use some. Thank ye.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
What brings you back?
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
I reckon not.
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
Karl is a guy guy?
Why won't he talk to women?
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Will he be supervised?
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
Do me a favor, will you?
Yeah, I did.
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
I didn't know you took pictures.
How old, kid?
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
Uh, better make it one.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
You got it.
I'm all ears.
Every word.
Yes, I suppose I do.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.
You don't give up, do you?
Still, you can't just write her off.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
Bully for you.
I can't believe it. Oh God, I can't believe it.  You're an angel, Auggie. An angel from heaven.
I almost got married once.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
What difference does it make?
And these?
I think I'll take them. 
The refrigerator?
You mean Rashid?
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
I shouldn't have let him go.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Those are pretty hostile words.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
The name is Cyrus Cole.
And have you mended them?
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
Aren't you going to say anything?
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
Baby? And what baby is that?
What are you talking about?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Well, if you put it that way...
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Why don't you go to the police?
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
What time did you get to bed last night?
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
And started to run.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Yes, please.
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
A thousand.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
You're implying th...
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
Japanese stick-fighting.  They're trained as kids, y'know.  To kill with sticks.
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
Won't take two.
No, you don't.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Well...
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
That's all he said.
Such as?
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
Of course I am.
Hey, Joe!
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Right.  We have the same blood type...
You've flipped your wig!
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
Tore off one of my chests.
Down, Daphne!
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Fight it.
Good night, Josephine.
And I'm not even pretty.
How can we?  We're broke.
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
Daphne, you're bothering us.
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
Have I got things to tell you!
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Like when?
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
Get me Room 414.
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
No, no.
I have a very low resistance.
When?
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
You betcha.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
I guess she's not in here.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
What do you think, Josephine?  What does it say in your crystal ball?
I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
- you got to be blonde -
Help yourself.
Me too.  Bye now.
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
Oh, you don't get off that easy.
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Sorry.
Why not?
Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
My car?  Why, you -
Oh.
Afford it?
Me?
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Just my feminine intuition.
My fault.
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
Could be.  Do you play the market?
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
Tonight?
Why?
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
Guess!
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
What's on Thursdays?
Is it that hopeless?
Have you ever tried American girls?
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
Tomorrow night?
I told you - I'm not very bright.
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Well, we all got to go sometime.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
You don't owe me no nothing.
But I do. I will. You’re my sister.
Are you sure you’re okay?
Hey.
It’s not me. I swear. It’s her. She’s magic.
Actually, I do.
Why, with you.
Sir, yes, sir!
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave?  You and Amy. Reunited.
You are taking the piss?
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
Shrink, actually.
Crikey.
Hello, Katmandu.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That’s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
When you’re ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.
Oh, cut the crap!
So, why’d you say yes to me?
Desperation?
What?! No, no. You can’t--
I get all the glamour jobs.
Meet Nick.
Ahoy!
Just drunk enough.
Will do.
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
Sure--
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
Yes, Miss Johnson...
I did look, Charlie, but I--
No buts, Rita!
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
No, son -- they'd have to kill me before I'd let 'em do that to me again!
September 4 -- how far away is that?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
Yes, David...
Yes, ma'am...?
David, come back here!
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
Don't mention this to anyone! You hear me, David!
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
Hope it don't freeze out our baseball game today!
Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
Doggy.
Success!! Our device works perfectly! We will begin mass production immediately!
I hate the environment.
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
YOU DO?!
Sure, dude.  On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby...
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
AGAGAH!!
Eric, that is not appropriate.
I don't know.
Something big, children.
Hey, Chef.
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
I don't know, dude.
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me!
Me?!
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
Yes?
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
Alright, I'll make the call...
You bet, Terrance!
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Oh yeah...
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
All right, I'll give it a shot.
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
It's steady, good benefits.
Thank you.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
You too.
I'll do my best.
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Hopefully sooner than later.
Over and out.
What do you mean?  What happened!
And so far.
He's in the bathroom.
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Mac.  What's shaking?
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
Wish me luck.
Who gave it to you?
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
You're a scumbag.
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
What ever happened to just bowling?
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
Four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for Team Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment.
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Business.
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
No. Not at the present.
Nothing.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
Come on, bargain with me.
What about the guy he put in the body cast?
Zip.
I'll be at the bridge.
It?
Tell me what happened Theo.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
I am a professional man.
Lips still for sale?
Can you change something this big?
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Open it, Captain!
How about I just press the button?
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
Then why am I here?
Geologists?
-- dating the crash at least that old.
Hold on --
What's wrong with oxygen?
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
She should've known better.
-- and then brought her down here --
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
They're coming.
In the ship, sir.
Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
I'm in charge.
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
What do you make of this?
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
What?
I love secrets.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
Because when we get down there --
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
We have a library?
My gosh, Norman.
You went through Edmunds' things?
You told him about me?
You did, didn't you?
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
Wait a second --
None of this was here before.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
Ulcers.
Nothing about drowsiness.
It's a soporific.
Three to six hours.
Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
How's Harry?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
Don't you?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
Did you?
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
It's not safe for you to be either.
I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
Beth -- gimme the gun.
Well, they're not mine.
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
It's an American spacecraft.
I never said that.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
Don't be defensive.
Wait a second, I --
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
She's lying, Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
Hold on.
Wait!
It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Arrived?  From where?
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
Told me what?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
You mean you don't know?
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
You seen my suitcase?
They never used to send a Navy car.
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
I'm beginning not to like you.
May the Force be with you.
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
I know that.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
Could I learn to feel it?
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
That's where my father was killed.
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
He can't find Organa Major.
I didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
I'll make a report later.
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
It's automatic.
You don't believe in the Force?
What are you saying?
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
No need, everything's under control.
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
Well, I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.
Something... I've got...you don't.
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Death to all bugs !
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
Your father will never let you.
Don't you have to finish the game ?
They revoke our flight status.
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
Zander, no...!
Excuse me...!
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Who cares ?
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Yes, ma'am.
Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Too bad for her if she's not around.
Sure.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
Keep trying, Sergeant.
Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir !
Engineering...
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
No!
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
No.
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
You bringing your new friend?
I need a typewritter.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
I understand...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
I thought you had Play Practice.
Uh huh.
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
You going to ask me in?
You believe that?
I do if you do.
...yes.
Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
Going home.
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
You know what else a man can do?
Not without a rolltop desk.
Well ain't you amazing.
But that's what happened.
I'm going to tell the truth.
...I'm sure that people are upset...
After Drama Group.
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
What is it, a surprise?
Yes, that's right.
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
I have to tell you something...
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
Hi.
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
That Could Be.
Nobody knows it but us.  Alright?  It says <u>here</u>...  Are we together on this?  Because it's sink or swim here, pals...
Nothing happened.
There's other things to be learned.
The Mayor's outside.
I, uh...  Um...
I wasn't in the car.
We know that you weren't.
Get him on the...
I'm not a <u>child</u>... I have <u>feelings</u>... Don't you...don't, don't...don't...
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
Now, look.  Claire:  Listen to me.  I want to tell you a story.
Yes.
I...
The minute I read that script I said...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
My wife's going to have a baby.
Mmmm.  You have children?
No.  No, but we're planning to.
The writer.
Not now.
Grace.  Get Mr. White a manual typewriter.  It's not a lie, it's a gift for fiction. And somebody find me my lucky pillow.
Did my matzohs come?  Get some for everybody.  Thank you.  Lemme tell you about my first movie...
You want me to lie.
He says they're looking for you all day, you're on <u>salary</u>, he needs <u>pages</u>, what are you, you been 'haying?'  Now:
How do you know you saw it?
You didn't see it...
You were there.  At...at 10:35...?
I...
That's thoughtful.  Ziz good, you try this?
How was your flight?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
I don't got the money.
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
It takes all kinds.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Ain't no second chances in life.
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Mass hysteria.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
Why does Rachel scream?
During sex.
What are you gonna talk about?
Like how?
She is but an arriviste.
Good girl.
Let me be the judge of that.
Thank God for that!
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
Not use my words, please!
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
A <u>suitable</u> boy, will be at <u>this</u> flagpole, <u>on</u> Monday, with a <u>very</u> expensive bike, and he will be a stone FOX if I have to call an <u>escort</u> service!
Cos she loves you.
I have lava.
Is that like Luigi's?
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
Mom...?
I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
Before you.
Rache says it's from you.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Let's take our best shot.
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
But you're not <u>done</u>!
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
WE are over.
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
Walk in the park.  And thanks for the 'we'.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
But it's not on the schedule!
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Not personally.
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
You're not dying.
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!
Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
She's devastated.
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
And her...?
What do I have that you don't?
Yeh, it's cheaper.
For what?
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
What's eight, ten years?  Hell, you'll still be ambulatory.  I think.
I know that.
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
Don't ever say that.
You heard me: leave the table!
And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined.
Thanks, Scoob.
I'll be your guest!
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
Must've been hard being poor.
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
No, Mikey.
No.
Poison gas.
I know!
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better…
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend.  Hey. Can you pass the salad over.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
Huh?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
We have to talk.
Tired of this shit...
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Hi, Dad!
Take off your top.
Ni...
...gger.
I dunno...
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Toby Oxman.
Great!
That's what I was gonna ask you.
But...you called.
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Anything I might know about?
That's good. So then what do you do now?
I do.
You should be.
Whoopee.
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
Yeah?...
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
The maintenance hatch--it takes us outside the building!
He's in there...
You can't think like that!  We're watching them like a hawk--he's bound to trip up, make one false move--
I'll let the senator tell you.
They were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time--without anyone being the wiser...
Excellent.
Agreed--let's move it.
Drop the anchor!
Get your men to do it!
What does that mean?
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
Yes, of course.
Oh, yes, that's right.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
What are you talking about, Major?
It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
Well, sir, about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders, General Jack D. Ripper, sent out attack orders to the thirty-four B-90's of the 843rd Bomb Wing, under his command.
Buck, when I told you to give them right up to the top, you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
Certainly, General.  Why do you ask, sir?
Condition Red!
Yes, sir.
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Where, sir?
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
Why can't you cancel it?
But we can't communicate with the base.
They're coming in now.
Maybe it's an exercise.
War?
Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
Maximum ECM!
What's your point, Lothar?
Seond safety.
Hell, he looks dead.
What are you talking about?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
How the hell do I know?  Maybe the war's over.
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Have you tried the emergency system?
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
Let me check.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Can I have some?
Yeah.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
Typical male.
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
Sorry.
I'd get bored.
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
So you can do an album cover?
No. Life is too short.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
What?
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Jeff! Let's go!
You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
Great.
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
I will.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
Glad it's okay.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Come on. Inside.
It's nice here. It's different.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
Oh, yeah?
What was your name again?
It's a mistake to think that.
Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
Oh, sure.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
I'd love to read that.
Funny shit, man.
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I gotta know what it's like to be on MTV.
What? What'd you do?
Well, w-what happened?
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
Just put it down.
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Look, your trespassing.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
You could've come over.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
Name one.
Tim!
Of course.
My goal is to make art.
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
Mm.
Jeff!
No. No, no, no.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
Well, what about us?
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Like songs?
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming.
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, this has everything to do with you.
Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem.  Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay.  You're fucked now, pal!  Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay.  Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck.  Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
Look at you!
Oh!
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
No, she was just sitting there?!
Yeah?
Oh, no, man. I can't.
Alright!
Yep.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
You do?
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Don't do that, man, okay?
So where are you?
At least I have a point of view, you know?
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
No car.
Cleo!
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
We were told you could "fix us up."
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
You're kidding.
Or, I could get my own horse...
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Ooops, hold on a sec.
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
You damn well better...
'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian!"
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
I didn't mean to --
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
It must be my new shampoo.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
It's a good script, isn't it?
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
They'll love it in Pomona.
This is fascinating.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
What month?
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
Okay.
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
Just follow me.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
I ran into some people I knew.
Where are my cigarettes?
Where are your...?
Maybe deMille is shooting.
Thank you, darling.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
I'm not here.
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
That's right.
What car?
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Maybe what you need is another agent.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Had he been trying to blackmail you?
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
Am I? Still?
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
What do you mean we?
Who didn't?
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
Let me kiss you.
No.
You're not afraid are you?
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
Like turning off a light.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
And you think you're in love.
I know it.
Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -
Can I quote you?
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
You bet your ass.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
What? Me?
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
Cheap but effective.
Not yet.
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
Buddy, are we in trouble.
Brad Wilson.
I seem to be.
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
Too much mayonnaise?
Who?
Call me.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Anyday...
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
Could you get me Superman's autograph?
Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
Oh?
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
What's that?
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
So where is all them half-centses?
I'm tryin' to.
Decaffeinated too?
Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee. 
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
Turn on the T.V.
What are you talking about, fella?
Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
Greed!  Let me tell you something---
They ain't got captains?
Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
We've already met.
You just did, with that great dinner.
It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...
That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
Where's the handle?
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Who needs Gus?
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
Hostages?
Actually, yes.
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Maybe you wanted to.
I didn't think I wanted to.
I'm listening.
Say you love me.
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Does she know about it? She's in it!
No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
It's beautiful.
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
Oh! That black box in our cell?
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
What do you want?
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
It will. Starting with your own.
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Free!
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
And I will lead.
Yes?
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
. . . Let me get my purse.
Clark. . . !
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
Like me?
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
You know him so well.  But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
But why the hair?
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
What's she doing in California?
I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
Besides that.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
First the pets, Otis.
You think he's for real?
Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
Bingo!
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
Lex is going bye-bye.
What other one?
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
But so is Vond-El
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
Gets you where you live, huh?
Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
Folks'll ask question.
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
He'll be weightless.
No! You couldn't imagine -
How good it felt -
And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do, Kal-El, even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...
Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
Uh-huh.
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Do you like pink?
Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
It is for me.
But...why?
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.
Alison.
I hope she gets better.
Case?
I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...
Yeah.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
We've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards.  We've got people pointing fingers, making side deals, and dickering over percentages. Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad.  The rescue squad.  Because they didn't act fast enough.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
A while.
Good night.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
Because I have to.
From what?
No.  I saw it on his face.
I don't know.  But it was weird in terms of what happened next.  Sean was still watching his mother.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
What happened to summer?
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
Did he say what about?
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
Oh.
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
Thank you, Nicole.
When?
People who will help our cause.
There's the Prescots...
Thanks.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
That's not news, Zoe.
No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
I need money.
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
Please.
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
How does the family survive?
Yes.
What time in the morning was this?
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot.
No.
Of course.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
As opposed to this T.V.?
You don't know that.
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
Is it news to you?
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
No, I'm not.  I'm not!
Who said Sidney?
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world.
No.  I'm going home.
I'll listen one more minute.
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
How?
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
The man in jail is always for freedom.
Talk to her yourself...
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
He wants me to break a leg?
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
May I rent you out as an adding machine.
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
If you want me to -
It is a favor, isn't it?
Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
Did you now?  On which bounce?
Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
Anything it samples by physical contact.
Prove it... stand on one foot.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
Pain causes it?
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
Uh huh.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Eating is eating... and...
Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
You bet.
I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
And your father was executed.
What's in those files?
What's not right?
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
Your guess is as good as mine.
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit!
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
Who warned you?
And what was that?
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
And what did he say?
And what happened to Von der Nul?
Yes, that's what happened.
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
Okay, so what is it?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Helmuth.
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
He did?
Who's he?
The Miracle Kid.
Like this bandleader.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
Come to the office, please.
Wrong.
What's it to ya?
You must have a girlfriend.
That's none of your business.
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
And you're from the future too?
Right.
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
It's okay.  Forget it.
Why?
My whole life has been combat.
Not possible.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
I know.
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
Projections were far too optimistic.
I don't think he's breathing.
What <u>is</u> your problem?
I'm sorry, about this...
Why not?
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
You first.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
Seriously?  What did they say?
Well... the red bra.
You don't have a choice.  No one else is going to tell you what's going on.
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
Scams, con games.  How many?
That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
Shut up!
No...
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Like... where are you from?
I redecorated.  What about you?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
Why?
Are you still on mediction?
Do it for YOU.
What's this all about, Connie?
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
Okay... okay.
Yeah.
Split it?
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Yes.
I hope.
Oh, here we go...
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
Well... send my love, if you see him again.
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Not much, I think.
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Don't ask.
It was a misunderstanding.
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
What about the house?
Attempted murder.
Greetings fellow sheep counter.
<u>Every</u> year is a good year.
Greetings.
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Just stay there, Nell!
Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
You could have.
No.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
What happened after you smelled it?
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
Nell, what do we do?
Yes.
I don't know what you mean.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
It's not a knock.
It must've been a time.  A golden moment.
I'm a gracious host.
I sure hope so.
We can't find ...  ... two of our guys.
What kind?
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
You think I'm staying?
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
You're home, then.
Round about, yeah.
Huh?
You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth.
Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing <u>them</u>.  Checking <u>them</u> out.  I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
Faith.
Do you have any friends, man?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
-- Mr. Lindgren.
My employer.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
Depends, don' it.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Fancy it?
Bloke told me.
Poor baby.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
What am I doing?
Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
Yeah.
Good luck.
What's in it?
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
Go now.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
Be seein' you.
And you should tell Doris...
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
...Uh-huh.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Then you listen to me, for I am expert. That girl, she give me a headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, I think, maybe, she make a very good typist.
No. I--tell me--
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
You're out of line, mister.
Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point?
How's business, Dave?
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
What kind of man *are* you?
Told what?
How's that?
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
...He told them to look at me--look at me close. That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that I was the barber, for Christ's sake...
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Uh-huh.
Whuddya mean?
What the--
...Nah.
Yeah.
The hell with it, Eddie!
Huh? No.
He's the dead guy.
You also have an interest in the securing property?
No thanks, I--
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent.
Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
Just a minute.  I'm shaking!  Take the gun.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
What doors?
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
Dr. Green has to see you!
Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news.  Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants?  Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
What is it?
I don't know.  But I think it's bad.
Like this.
They were yellow!
Keep the light up.  I can't see.
How does it work?
I don't understand.
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
It's scared of me.
Then it won't go after the others?
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
I have to shoot.
I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
<i>Fiji.</i>
No, hold back...
He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.
Sweep the harbor.
We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
That and a fat, new contract.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
<i>You</i> were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.
--You never had a camera in my head.
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
The memory of who?
I can't believe he married Meryl on the rebound.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
So when are you leaving?
Nursery?
Sorry, I'm way behind.
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
You hate gambling.
That's right.  I do, don't I?
There's been an accident, Truman.
So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea?  I'd better call your mother when we get there.  She'll be worried sick - I don't know how she's going to take this.
You're part of this, aren't you?!
--Truman, you're gonna be late!
How's your hip?
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
Is there any way around?
Who?
You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman.
You're not FBI agents.
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Brought on by what?
You a reporter?
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
I don't either, but it sure sells books.
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
That would be my guess.
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
You've been using me --
I've been using you?!
Where are you, Scully?
I'm on the roof.
I think they have that covered.
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
They were the ones that put us together.
I was until about an hour ago.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
Mulder --
Been where?
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
Just like that --
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
On whose orders?
Where's Scully?!
About the conspiracy?
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
What do you mean, walked?
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
I realize that...
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
Yep.  Eloped.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
I think that's the whole point.
You're looking well.
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
Considering where I've been...
Das worren nooh zeiten.
Mmmm.
They're forged.
Need we go through it all again?
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
Tell me more.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
Holly.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Why?
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
He liked to laugh.
Oh...
No.
No.
Two weeks ago.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
I don't want it.
Fellow called Lime.
Martins.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
I can't say that I have.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
Best thing that ever happened...
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Fifty yards right down there.
Of course.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Win what?
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
No, a major, were you really?
Heard of Harry Lime?
Certainly.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
The Roumanian?
Vinkel.
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Yes.
I am not a bad man.
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
I thought he'd be here to meet me.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Thanks.
One or two kilometers.
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
Fuck off.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
No.
So?
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
I don't, but...
Let's look at the fucking thing.
Too difficult?
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
I just read it....
You want it to be an event.
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
Bigger and better.
No.
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
What assholes.
You can't curse in front of it either.
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
No difference.
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
Lina, come here!
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
I'd have to research it, study his routines, his security.... But ideally on a New York street at midday, using a small-caliber automatic without a silencer.
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Why?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
Who killed Manzetti?
Get the fuck away from me.
Think about your father. Your sister.
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
You could do it.
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
So that's what? Nineteen thirty minutes...what time is it now...
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
I can tell....
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
What?
What do you mean?
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
I can't... I just don't know how to...
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
What kind?
Johana, am I boring you?
I said that the file is incomplete.
What was he like, when he was little?
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Okay.
Yes...
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
Why?
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
It isn't lit yet.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
Noireuter.
No...
They say I'm like Lazarus.  You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
Why?  Are they what's most important?
Everything about what?
If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
You don't have that one, do you?
I don't want to erase anything.
You say that because you have the title!
Thank you...
Lucky I was there to save you.
Give it to me.
I did?
I'm still here.
You'll try again tomorrow?
I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
You go back, I'll walk.
You want to lie down for a while?
You are the father.
Promise you won't forget me.
Johana... New York.
Well... here.
It's my apartment.
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
... Sally?
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
They're going to send detectives.
Way past it.
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
... Yes?
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
What's your first move?
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
I know sir. I won't let you down.
C'mon follow me.
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother.
Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
That depends. How much money has he?
I drink.
I sleep it off.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
It was you.
It's better you don't know.
They do, but -- there are no lights out there —- they'll just be shadows -—
Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
And I never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing But this is serious competition.
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
And I never will -- you know what's between us -— we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
Must it?
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
Will you please come with me?
No. Thank you. I’ll be fine...
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
Couldn’t Nazi hunters do the job?
Who is Friedman?
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
I guess the news you’d sent me after Friedman didn’t go down too well, eh?
It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. What’s harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He’s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Leon hung himself...
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
Don’t you believe in simplicity?
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That’s when he hit me, and told me he’d killed my brother... “You don’t know what you’ve done,” he said.  “We’re in deep trouble,” he said. “We,” he said. “We.”  We’d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
Get to the point, will you...
You wouldn’t understand.
01766 770 471. Let me check it for you, sir.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There’s a dirt track with a ‘Closed to the public’ sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven’t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. There’s a lot of people back there. They’re holding a seminar. Trafficking’s the past, breeding the future...
So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
No. You’re looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there.  Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit...  Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?
This is a bad line.
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
Yes. Friedman’s the fuckin’ Austrian!
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Oh... We split up.
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
Carlos De Moraes?
Yes. How did...
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Okay. Recommended...
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
Then why aren’t you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
We conclude our transaction.
Look, I don’t think you’re fully aware of what you’re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don’t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
Huh... I’m sure there’d be lots of takers.
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Oh. This is... We’d arranged to meet tonight and I’m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Should I be?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
Is she on the phone?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You don’t know Leon, do you?
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
If you can, send me a receipt.
Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as “Never Forget”. Over the years we’re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Mossad?
It’s a good guess...
Costliest!
I don’t know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
... if she can find me? -- That's a brilliant idea!  If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man!  Bring her up!
Now?
Better today than tomorrow.
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
So... what am I supposed to do now?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
I don't know it.  I feel it.
You make it sound so simple...
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
Tell me...
But it is what I want.
But... why... what's the point?
I'm staying, Jean.
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
No.  But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
Performing a miracle.
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
Rouen is in English territory.  I have the right to do anything I like.  Take them away.
I was so worried -- we've all been looking for you!  The English are everywhere!  O thank you, lord!
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
But where are you going to be?
I understand.  How much?
For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
I'm... I'm not the king...
I didn't wait long.  One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
What difference does it make where she comes from?
The other half.
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
We're taking back the Tourelles!
The English won't wait.
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
Good idea...
The English are rebuilding it.
Perfectly.
Reinforcements?  Where??
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
I... submit to Our Lord.
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
Did your voice tell you to jump?
That's now what I meant...
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
It's not possible...
My king.
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
I might ask you the same question.
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
No.  That was a sword in a field.
Oh no?  How about this one?
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
No, I...
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
Why did she have to die?
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
I'll see you...soon.
What's happened?
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
There are always notices going up.
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
Dirty pig!
Where do you live?
We're getting out.
Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him ... we have had some tears
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
Spoken words?
Everyone has to practice.
Do I know any gigs?
That's right.
No, no cops!
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
We'll be waitin'.
I like griftin'.
Which one?
Who's got the contract?
They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed.  They figure maybe he skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em up?
All he's gotta do is read.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
I picked something up on the way.
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
I never played for winos.
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
Neither are we.
Let him wait.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.
Did he hold you up on anything?
I thought I'd lost him.
See and raise five.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
Yeh, sleepin'.
What the hell for?
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
I am after this race.
Why don't ya then.
How am I gonna do that?
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
Never heard of the place.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth.
We'll see you before you go.
He was?
Why not?
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
Oh.  I'll do my own typing!
It's all right.
You better take a drink.
I can't.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
No.
Did he tell you where he was going?
He's all right.
Not at all.
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
So you say -  Go on, Bob.
No.
He's holding out on you.
Nunheim!
I see.
Goodbye.
That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
I guess all the suspects are here.
All right.  All right.
Just what I said I'd do.
Never mind.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
I can't! I haven't got it!
No.
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
Hello....  Where?  In Allentown.  Yes... When is the next train? Right - I'll get that.  Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him.  I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it?  That looks like an admission of guilt.  And I had such hopes.  I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him.  I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that....  Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now.  I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
Hello, baby.
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
That's jolly.
Maybe it would if I took it.
Breakfast.
Want a drink?
You talk as if I were Asta.
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
You dog!
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all --  If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
Huh?
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Got a nice evening dress?
The suspects!  They won't come.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
Yes.  Nick!
Maybe she has.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
What about Jaeger?
What are you doing?
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.
What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
...I know.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Mine.  Land mine!
Just be cool.
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
Is it all right if I stand up?
Sure.
You still got a map on you?
What?  Yeah.
I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to--
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
How do we do that?
Threatened to blow my brains out?
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
For real?  A treasure?
Naw, nothing.
It doesn't mean anything.
So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
How the hell should I know how much?
We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
Yeah, we're down.
All last night he could have been--
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
Stress category.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
No, don't make trouble.  It's nothing.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
What?
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
We're leaving.
What?
Who?  Who's leaving?
THX and me.
Impossible!
What?
You're in violation.
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
What kind of answer is that?
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
Where's LUH?
I thought of something.....
Yes...
Go ahead.
Mike Reilly.
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
How do you know?
You got it.
Make up your mind, trigger.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
What... ?
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
It's from an IRA.
We work fast enough for you?
We've created a monster.
Nothing... just tired.
Alex, please.
But sir--
Shit. We're fucked.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
IRA - instant retirement account.
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
I promised her she'd be safe.
It's our only option.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
And it had diamonds in the back.
At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
About tonsils.
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
No.
Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
I thought so.
Just dull.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.
I don't want to see you at all!
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
Very well, m'sieu.
What do you mean?
M'sieu Monescu!
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
Why should you?
Thank you!
Gaston!
Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace  and made it into a lamp for my night table?
The fourteenth of May.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
Seven and nine!
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
Certainly!
They're all right, aren't they?
He recognized you!
That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.
Oh!
But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.
Make it out to cash!
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
I'll be delighted.
Like that?
I'm crazy about you!
Please! 
Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
Goodbye.
Yes--uh--
What is it, madame?
No, m'sieu!
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
About what?
Naturally not!
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
Very well, madame. Thank you. 
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 
Because I hate him--because I love you!
I'm tryin' boss.
Get that outta my face.
A hundred and one next month.
Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead.
Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.  You see this? Right here?
No, trust me, you want to take this call.
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
Not the better half.
No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
No, no! Just with her hands.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
A mistake?
Jack, I --
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
I'll wait here.
I'm so cold.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
How can you put this on my shoulders?
I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Will you leave me alone?
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
Montana?
What did you want a gun for?
Guess again, copper.
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
Yes--
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
Well, I can't.
When?
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Sally--!
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
--there's thousands of 'em!
No, sir?
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
I'll take one. 
Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
Much better--thank you--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
Why, I--
Thanks. That makes us square.
Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
June? That's my wife's name.
I can see you're no gentleman--
I thought I put you to bed.
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Very good, Mary--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Well, he has a straw hat--
Good-night, folks.
No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
The country boy's about due.
I went for four.
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
Let me look at it.
Ain't got time.
Actually, you know, that's not a Bad idea, send a signal we're Growing up.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
You whore!  You filthy whore!
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
Excuse me?
Already got a guilty conscience, Might as well have the money too.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
I was kidding about that.
Enough?  Never.
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
No...
Revenge?  For what?
How you feelin', Doc?
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
You'd die for fun?
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
Getting late.  We better get back.
I didn't mean it that way.
Well sure, neighbor, easy to say.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
Acquired?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
Come. Let's get out of the noise.  - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk.
I see.
I can feel your pain.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
So why did you leave?
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
Is that any way to say hello?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Can you arrange a meeting?
Happily.
... Kids?
Thanks.  Take care -
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
No?
- You're not.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
He's killed closer.
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
I didn't say when I want to die -
And number two?
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
You come with me -  You stay here.
Fueled and waiting.
Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???
Abort the cruise.
Junior spends time with his child.
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
Like muddy waters?
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
Son, I can take everything you got with that deck. It is marked. Now I'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Not anymore, not in the city.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra and I thought you need a rest. I'll stand guard. Okra wants to talk to you anyway.
Hattie is a different person now.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
My mother passed on years ago.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
He is in his pigeon cage.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
Okay.
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Here!  In the car!
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Where is it?  I don't see the --
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
What?!
Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
Stay calm, everyone!!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Everyone, it's Woody!
I can't see a thing!
Miss.  G-6.
Heh-heh.
She's sick!
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
Nothing.
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Yes SIR!
Huh?
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
Didn't you know he made things?
Do what?  Oh, I see.
Ah, come on now!
You did what?
Surely she is older?
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
He's not here.
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
Listen to me carefully.  First of all, Carl isn't here.  DEA's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow.  So here you're wasting your time.  Are you with me?
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
I don't know.
At least she's alive.
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
Sorry, but I mean, come on.
What's up?
Helena --
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
In school?
I'm third in my class.
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
I feel good.
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
Especially Tiger Woods.  ...Actually, he keeps his on the back seat.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
When will you do it?
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
So you pay off our customs officials?
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
I don't think you're going to do that.
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
An informant.
What is it you want me to do?
It could mean that, yes.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
I have money --
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
Yes, I hope so as well.
What do you mean?
I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized.
What kind of research?
No. On you go.
Well, I've not brought them.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Did you bring the cards?
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
No.
The point is, you've got to find something new.
Do you recall the school motto?
Aye.
Cheers.
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
And you might get the fucking job.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Roald Dahl.
What do you mean?
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
I don't rate that at all.
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
It wasn't that bad.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
It was just an idea.
So we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me about a skag deal?
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
Sounds great, Swanney.
Sure will, pal, sure will.
Six weeks and no sex?
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
A walk.
It could. Yes.
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
Plotting our new course.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
Oh, please.
Have the Klingons responded?
Understood. Kirk out.
What is it you seek?
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
Yes.
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
Be one with the horse.
Let me do something.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
Is what possible?
That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
Because you, too, must know.

"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
He's not?
Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
Of what?
Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
Alan. Alan Bailey.
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
Right on the money!
Yes, okay, exactement!
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
I'm sorry -
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
If you think -
Hah.
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?
You're alive!
Wrote the...?
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
Not us, I hope.
Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
It's too far!
Tron...?
It grows on you.
Little more juice's all it needs...
Good luck. You can't even think in here.
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
It's something Users do.
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.
I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  You never used to lie to me.  But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
You're kidding.
Yes.
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy?
I'll just hang then, shall I?
It can't be.  Not Helen.
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
You tell on me, I tell on you.
You know about that?
I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
I adore it.
Is that why you got into this business?
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
What'd you do, honey?
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
No.  Doris.
Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
Are we going to die?
No.  Much more.
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
He said he was an American agent.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.  See-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running					* shootout, ending at the						* Marriot...
It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
You'll call me then?
I just glances inside.
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
I didn't get any chicken.
How come?
Ya looked through it?
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
Tell me about yourself.
Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
Burt Reynolds.
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
Who and what is a Drexl?
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
Who the fuck are you?
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
I certainly hope so.
I know.
Tell me.
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
In case.
I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
Three kung fu movies.
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?
You were a cop.
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
What about him?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Sure was.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
You're no longer an extra -
He produced "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
That's bullshit.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
No.
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
This is it, James...what you've been working for.
Shut up!
I need to go now.
Do you know why you're here, James.
A jail?  Prison?
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...
I've got one now.
It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you.
Flowers!  What flowers?
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
Plan?  What are you talking about?
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
How did you find me?
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
Then how come she knows what's going on?
I'll be right here...just in case.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
Christ!
I'll bet my watch against your pay.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
It will.
I don't care, just get me there.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
You Harlin?
You own this place?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
How much time?
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
You son of a bitch!
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
Come back when the sun comes up.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
Taking a little trip?
Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?
Wrong number.
You haven't even looked at them once.
Uh-huh
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
Jake.  No.  No!
You sure you can manage?
No trouble at all, really.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
I just drove in this morning.
What happens if you lose?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
What?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Still playing?
You know what I want.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
You could just leave him.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls.
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
Where are you going?
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
It's our money.  He had no right to take it.
Where the hell am I going to go?
What for?
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Wait a second--
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
You meant it.
And for that you'd kill Grace?
How much could you get?
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife . . .?
Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
Damn it, Jake.  If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me.  And if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two- hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money.  I've got to have the money.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
You're too quick for me.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
What the hell are you talking about?
What's your name anyway?
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.  Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
A hundred-forty-five really.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
You ain't passing these test, son. If I can't trust you I'm gonna have to arrest you . . .
Soda.  You know.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
Christ no!
What do you want for free?
I got things to do.
You afraid of the dark?
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
Who the hell are you?
Say, what happened to your hand?
You've got to be--
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
I did?
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
Be quiet, boy.  I got to figure this thing. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be...
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
What are you talking about!
Got any requests?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
But he's dead.
Darrell--
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
What sign?
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
No! No police.
Maybe I don't want you to.
I like that about me, beautiful.
That's all right.  I got it.
Where'd you learn to do that?
What?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Is that why you're with him?
Walk away.
Yeah.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
<u>I don't know why</u>!
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh...
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
There's someone in the house.
What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
I have a lock on the door.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Oh.
Yes. Is this David?
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
Are you for real?
You thought he was carrying a knife?
I don't know what you're asking?
Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
We are.
He's kind of a miracle.
What's he look like?
Jeremy listen to what--
Was your family traveling with you?
How did you get together?
...And everyone lived happily ever after.
Where is it?
But what they done, they...
I fined 'em instead.
You told them cowboys you had it.
No?
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
What's all that wood?
Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
I could run off them whores.
Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
Letters?
Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell.
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
Yeah, I guess so.
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
She's passed on, Kid.
Huh?
Huh?
Well... I don't recollect.
After a ways.
Yeah, he's in there.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Yeah.
Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.
Lemmee see it.
You ain't shot.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Sometimes... yeah.  I don't miss it all that much.
He hit you?
How far kin you see?
Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
Yeah... you said that last night.
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Easy, Bill, easy.
The Kid, yeah...
Did I what?
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
What was the money for?
There's more.
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
Goddamnit.
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
I love you.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
What do you care what he says?
Dig.
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
This I had to see myself.
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
Neither do we.
Business or personal?
Where?
Which is shit.
I just want to hear your story.
You know Ruby is in Attica?
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
This is totally irrelevant.
I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
I don't
No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will.
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Gruber...
What does it mean?
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Well, many reasons, actually...
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
No.
...of Anesthesiology?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
It's a crime.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
Hold on a second.
I am seventy-four years old.
The Doctors were not negligent.
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
... and you're going to do that?
You're going to settle out of court?
Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
I understand.
... that's perfectly all right.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
What?
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
I can't guarantee that...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
How come you're calling me from...?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
And are they going to get it?
What happened...?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
If I don't 'grow up...'
What are you going to do?
He's not in, Sir.
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
...I'm going to need your help...
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
No.
Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
Yeah.
The Doctors.
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
... I'm sure you do ...
... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
Mrs...
That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
He won't talk.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
And you like it.
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
No.
How often does this happen?
Scottie, I need a friend!  Someone I can trust! I'm in a panic about this!
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
There are things you didn't tell me.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
She... went into the Bay.
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
I want to know who you are.
Mmm.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
That's not very complimentary, either.
Why?!
I want to! Come on!
Judy --
It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
Yes. Yes, I do.
Wherever you'd like...
Is that the best you can do?
Too late. I've got my face on.
How does it work?
To complete my cure.
I need you.
Scottie --
Your accident...
Some money.
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
No...
Oh... wandering about.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
You've nothing to apologize for.
No! No, thank you!
The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
I don't like them.
No birds live here.
No.
Madeleine!
The tall trees...
When?
Long ago...
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
Why did you jump?
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
Where?
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
No!
Yes?! But --
And it's a all real.
Yes.
You can't.
Where?
Oh, yes!
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
It wasn't your fault.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
Aren't you ever going to get married?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Just wander.
Where?
Yeah.
Naturally.
Wandering.
What is it, a still life?
No, not exactly. Want to see?
I thought so!
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
You go home!
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
I'm calling the ambulance.
Just giving the facts.
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
They won't figure it out.
Don't ever stare him down.
If anything ever happens to me...
It has to be done.
Who?
What is her disposition?
Who's up for making some real money?
Shut up.
He's having a problem here.
Take care of business.
What does that mean?
You got a nasty side to your thought process.
Now?
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
True.
Israel doesn't have a King.
Not really, no.
No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.
Easy Micheal.
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
Goosed!
Why can't we do it through the mail?
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
I think I forgot the tent.
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
Well it's bad timing.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
He's a great chef.
Time out.
You will not be common!!!
We're leaving in three hours.
I need your help.
Well I do.
Yeah. Nesting.
Hey. It's me.
How late?
The chairs.
I'm working on it.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Don't even.
What?
Micheal, by accident.
What money?
Move the bodies?
What?
No...
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
About what?
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
...embarrassing, shameful...
Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling.
Drum banging real times.
It was an accident!
That's right.
Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
Then it's a respectable house.
What's that?
What about them?
No.
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
Yes, it is.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
And what do you know about life? When all is said and done you couldn't possibly understand.
I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
Nothing.
It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
Well... is it so urgent?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
Is she coming back?
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
Things seem to be getting better.
Don't say that.
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
He's lying through his ass!
You cannot leave ...
Where?
A black bull!
This louse is looking for trouble.
Why wasn't I told?
Catch him and your record's clean.
I wish we could hear them.
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
You son—of—a—bitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
You think he's smart?
What's the assignment?
Don't remind me.
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
I was assured the problem was corrected.
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
This is supposed to be years away.
Talk so I can understand.
Then fix it.
I think I understand what you have in mind...
Enough!
Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
What happened when he was 17?
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son—of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
My guess is dead.
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common —— we have such history together ——I've been thinking we should become friends.
Why's that?
Where did you plant the C-4?!
I've got some final preparations to take care of—— Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty!
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
What'd ya think?
Indeed it is.
Oh, Lord....
Come on.
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
Who's got the story? 
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
It won't hold.
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
And you?
One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
I'll see you at National.
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
Who's gonna tell'em.
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
The Ribbon Manufacturers.
Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
An <u>Albanian</u>, a young Albanian Girl.
...uh huh...
Y'wanna follow the Cattle Drive?  Sleep in the Winter. What does <u>Moss</u> want...?  Matchmaker comes to the Levinsky Family.  Mr. Levinsky, Mrs. Levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul, from Princess Margaret of Great Britain.  Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done.  Now, Look:  I got the <u>file</u>, from the L.A. contingent, I got the day-by-day, of how...
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
...how ya feeling, boy?
Whaddaya think?
Would you go to War to do that? 
Well, I have, too.  Would you do it <u>again</u>...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess <u>so</u>.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and <u>Togo</u>? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>over</u>.  The War of the Future is <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah. And to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>.  You have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, <u>this</u>  is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there <u>ain't</u> no war but ours. 
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the President, there will he an update at 5:45.'
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
...uh ... No, that's...
We remember the slogans, we can't even remember the fucking <u>wars</u>.  Y'know why.  Cause it's <u>show business</u>. That's why I'm here.  Naked girl, covered in Napalm. Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi. Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf War?  Smart Bomb, falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day, 100 days, <u>One Shot</u> of One Bomb.  The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you?  War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business, Mister Moss.  That's why I'm here.
Why not?
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
...it's a Teaser!
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
"Back End" ... count on it.
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
They got him standing by.
Oh, you're gonna love this:
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
Yes, William, Uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?
Finish Strong!  Are you <u>nuts</u>?  Are you nuts?  This's Pennies from <u>Heaven</u>... on his triumphal return home, Old Shoe, his Plane Forced Down...AND YET...
No.  You're right.
I'm looking for a phone...
Watch me.
It's too clean.
Hold it a minute, Benny, we're going to tweak it a bit.  This may take a while.
Keep Talking....
What guards Us Against Canada...?
Military Special Programs... <u>Programs</u>... No, I am not Shouting at you, I'm... I'm sorry.  Anyone named <u>Shoe</u> Schumann?  <u>Schuster</u>... uh
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
Yes.
I believe in you....
The hats.
Is today Laundry Day...?
How 'bout a Cold Drink...?
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
a "pond," or
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer...What's your favorite drink?
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin.
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life.
All right, I owe you one Marv.
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
How's Mom?
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
What if he asks where I got the money?
Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on.
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
Excuse me sir.
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
How much?
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
Upper West Side.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
Why?
I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
Businessman?
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
A little?
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
Safety in numbers man.
Right behind you.
Sell my soul?
What do you mean?
A ghost?
What does she look like?
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Who's that?
That's not...It's not like that.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
Um...sure.
You know where she is?
Oh God...
Good.  I'm good.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
Yep.
It's niiice.
You got it.
This.
M-E...
What?
Why?
All of us.
No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
It's Saturday.
Nope.
Yep.
You're kidding.
Did you tell her?
What?
No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this.
It's a ghost.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
When?
...like it never even happened...
We're going to be fine.
What are you...?  No.
No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
Yep.
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
But I don't remember.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
Not personally.
Wouldn't go that far.
It's too rough.
Oh God...
Stop...
Claire...
We don't know that for sure.
I don't believe you.
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
Then what is he...?
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
Nothing was ever more false.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
I'm coming down there!!  And it you put my mother in the ground betore I arrive, you'll wish you'd never seen my face!  IS THAT UNDERSTOOD...?!
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
Better than most, I suppose.
You're a monster.
ENOUGH!!!
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
Now, lasher - it is our time.
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
Explain this to me --- violated...?
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
If that were true, I would not be here.
From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. and Deborah.  Stella - Marguerite - Antha  - Diedre -  All of them.  And you will have a child...
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
Do not tell me that!
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
Rowan...
You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
I'm serious.  You don't -

Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
- a witch.
Hello..
That's cause we're below sea level.
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
You bastard!
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
BRIAN...
But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?
What's with all the locks - and hammering
I'm a dentist
You don't know?
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
then why did you marry her -
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
Why not? Please - it would help me
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
I am sorry...
No - a dentist
No worries
And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
Yes - of course.
Yes...?
She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
Maybe he got promoted.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
And some really fast cars.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
You have changed since second grade.
Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.
Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
The lesson being?
They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
Want a lesson?
The one with the horses.
Hmmm?
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Of course we were.
I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation.
It's not up to me.
I miss them, too.
You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
Me?
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Amen to that.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
But absolutely true.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
Only the best for my mother.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
You called the cops on us?
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
Yeah.  Everything's cool.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
Kelly.
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
And the child...
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
He was large?
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
You mean he withdrew...
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
Suzie Toller is missing.
You could tell me where you were last night.
I net a guy in a bar.
Why is that?
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
I said he did.
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Curiosity, I guess.
About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
I would hardly say you look like trash.
A friend of mine bought a boat.
I won't.
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra...
Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
Yes.  Now, observe....
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
It's a town!
We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
Oh, thank you.
But it only has six legs.
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
Fine, I'll stop.
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
Dr. Loveless?
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
Yes!
When are they coming?
Let's go.
I love you.
Farmer.
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
Elora Danan!
You?
Who?
Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything?
She's a bird, Willow.
I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
His will.
Ouch!  Let go of me!
Who is he?
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Cows. You know, cows?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Pretty much.
Maybe.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
No you're not –  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
Hochmut?
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
No. I'd want a public phone.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
Say again?
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
I don't know where he is.
That is idle talk.
Lean on him.
You have no right here!
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
Is morally, ethic'ly
Do you presume to criticize the....
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
I don't believe you!
Goodbye, folks!
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
Oh!  Well....
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Oh --
No, they won't - honestly.
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
Me?
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Oh --
You've had plenty of time already!
Yes...!
No, but you tried to.
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
It's pleasant down that way, too.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Ohh!
Did I scare you?
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Oh --
Leave her alone!
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
Somebody pulled my tail.
What was that?
Yeah!
I want to see you and your wife right away....
NO!
No, sir!
We do.
A heart --
Yes.
Ho -- ho --ho
Go on!
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Yes -- ....
Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.
So who are you?
Alright then, brunch.
I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
I was hoping you could tell me.
The King pipeline.
If I don’t get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden’s Tower, M is dead.
She’s not a girl anymore.
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I’d do the same again.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
The worm on the hook again.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
It’s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldn’t have done it without you.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
He used your exact words.
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
What’s your business with Elektra King?
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
Where it can do the most damage.
Still no contact yet.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Washington?
Who is she?  Do you know her?
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Mm hmm.
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Jon -- what??
She's with me.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
Did you know he was back on the streets?
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I "walked" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
Yeah, I spy or I die.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
Yorgi asked me to.
You do everything Yorgi says?
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
I'm from L.A.
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
You don't have to do that.
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
Let me.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
You wanna see my politics?
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
No!
What was your grandfather's name?
... No!
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Love me oodles and oodles?
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Goodbye, darling.
Darling!
Love me?
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
That's my good boy.
It seems fine.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
I didn't do that.
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
A piece of what?
But, sir...
But your grandfather's work, sir...
You must be Igor.
How do you do?
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
More, do you hear me?
Throw the third switch!
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
All right -- where is she?
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
That sound good, boss.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
But who was playing it?
Are you serious??
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
Yes, I will.
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
Do Something!  Stall them!
I'm sorry, sir.  We only seat by reservation.
They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD
Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
Yes.
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
